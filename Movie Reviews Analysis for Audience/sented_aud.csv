There's a lot of comic book movies now, and most of them seem to have given up on the basic idea that super powers can be fun and interesting in favor of a lot of punching.

Kartikey G,"This is a fun Marvel movie, almost up to the level of the first Guardians of the Galaxy film. I love Paul Rudd and he does a terrific job making his character relatable, and punching up the humor in the otherwise over serious plot. Some aspects are a bit silly, like all MCU movies. And some plot points are treated with heavy generic score like we were watching hybrid of a period drama and a summer blockbuster. This gets even more off the rails in the next Ant-Man, but for the most part this one manages to return to the focal points of the story with the Pym particle and the suits. It's crazy that just by blowing shit up or sucking it into a vanishingly small dimension that somehow this technology has been contained to only the ""good guys"". That said, very entertaining, and I'd watch it again.",2-Mar-22,4.5,0.057,0.798,0.145,0.8844,,,,,,

Matthew D,"A magnificently inventive comedy that never lets up on laughs or heart. Director Peyton Reed's superhero, science-fiction, crime comedy Ant-Man (2015) delivers one of Marvel's most heartfelt and funniest movies yet. I originally enjoyed Ant-Man the first time around the molecule, but upon revisiting Ant-Man, I realized it's easily the funniest Marvel movie and brilliantly written and crafted. Ant-Man is essentially a heist thriller mixed with a family drama and absurdist comedy all in the guise of a superhero blockbuster. Ant-Man must be seen to be believed as Reed makes you care about this loser cat burglar Scott Lang and the often joked about comic book superhero Ant-Man. I simply adored Ant-Man! Even though producers Kevin Feige and Stan Lee foolishly fired director Edgar Wright, Wright stayed on as producer, story lead, and head writer for Ant-Man. Peyton Reed proved to be a smart and formidable choice as director for Bring It On and Ant-Man are fabulous films in their own right. Reed's use of stellar realistic CGI aids his stunning visuals for Ant-Man's shrinking sequences as he uses all assorted ants and scenarios to creatively showing Ant-Man's physics, place, movements, strength, and inventive tactics. Russell Carpenter's cinematography is so playful and striking as Ant-Man is shown next to people and props for scale as to his size in these intimate close-up shots and daring wide shots that never cease to captivate and delight. You can never guess where Ant-Man will go next. It's an experience unlike anything Marvel have never dared to try before. I loved the bathtub water chase, breaking into a safe with nitrogen, the ant aided heist antics, to the innovative train collision final battle. You never question the physics and science of Ant-Man's shrinking, growing, impressive strength, and ant controlling. Editors Dan Lebental and Colby Parker Jr. get high marks for their piercingly sharp hard cuts from chaotic Ant-Man action visual mastery to cute edits back to regular reality size to juxtapose how silly Ant-Man's small conquests are in context. I love the hectic feel during the action, but the controlled editing with a really funny humor to the rapid cuts. Writers Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd really delight with their hilarious absurdist jokes, surreal sci-fi concepts, creative fight sequences using Ant-Man's tiny size to his advantage, and genuine character drama that feels actually sweet. Ant-Man will make you laugh, cry, and gasp with joy at these cute ants and their multitude of uses. I am floored that Wright, Cornish, McKay, and Rudd make Ant-Man feel real and relatable to the point you are actively rooting for him in every scene. Scott Lang is an everyman of likable personality, bad luck, easy going charm thanks to Paul Rudd's endearing performance. Writers Paul Rudd, Edgar Wright, Adam McKay, and Joe Cornish create and adapt high sci-fi concepts right out of the old Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classic Ant-Man comic books. I appreciate their care and humor. Paul Rudd is phenomenally endearing as idiotic cat burglar and brilliant mind Scott Lang. He's actually cool and funny as Ant-Man. I had a smile on my face the entire time Rudd was delivering his goofy lines. Rudd is instantly one of my favorite Avengers after Ant-Man's display of empathetic humanity, good nature, outrageous humor, wicked shrinking powers, cute ant mind control, and creative combat. Paul Rudd is a natural actor with perfect charm and high charisma. What an inspired casting choice. Paul Rudd embodies the selfless heroism, intellectual solutions, and pleasant manner of Ant-Man. Michael Douglas is touching and intelligent as the genius inventor and original Ant-Man himself Dr. Hank Pym. His neat Pym Particle and quantum manipulation is fascinating and Douglas sells you on every crazy concept with his heavy gravitas and iconic charms. Evangeline Lilly is truly gorgeous and intriguing as Hope van Dyne with her awesome fight choreography and mean girl acting. Lilly carries herself with sheer confidence in her skills and with subtle grace over Hope's conflicted feelings for her father Hank Pym. She had real romantic chemistry with Paul Rudd that keeps you enthralled by their quirky relationship. I cannot wait to see her as Wasp alongside Paul Rudd's wonderful Ant-Man. Judy Greer is adorable and tender in her very raw emotional performance as Scott Lang's disappointed former girlfriend Maggie. She's so pretty and engaging as Maggie that she should be the obvious replacement for Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp if Marvel decides to oust Lilly for her ludicrous, selfish, and unsafe anti-vax sentiments. Bobby Cannavale's police officer Paxton is pretty serious, but he eases up on the dumb, intruding cop bit as he genuinely just cares for his wife and daughter. Corey Stoll is entertaining as the raving, egomaniac, scientist, and capitalist businessman Darren Cross who becomes the scary shrinking villain Yellowjacket. Anthony Mackie has a great sense of humor and humility to not only cameo as Falcon in Ant-Man, but also get his backside handed to him by such a tiny and ridiculous opponent. Abby Ryder Fortson is funny and cute as Paul Rudd's sweet daughter Cassie. Michael Peña is a riot as he babbles on about nothing and narrates his random meetings for heists as the hilarious side character Luis. David Dastmalchian's funny Russian accent and nervous hacking as Kurt is fun. T.I.'s casual observations and deadpan delivery is very funny as Dave. Hayley Atwell is still lovely and moral as Agent Peggy Carter. John Slattery just is Howard Stark to me. Gregg Turkington's cameo is absolutely a five bags of popcorn level of acting precision and hilarity. Anna Akana is jaw-droppingly beautiful and truly funny in her cameo as a hot writer. Stan Lee got a laugh out of me as the bartender in Luis' same story flashback. Spongebob's voice actor Tom Kenny even cameos as the voice of Cassie's ugly rabbit plushie. Shepherd Frankel's production design lays out these charming little sets both in the room and for the visual effects artists to play around with during Ant-Man's wild power displays. The art directors and set decorators did a great job making the homes warm and look lived in and the Pym science building look sterile and cold. Composer Christophe Beck provides a lively and fun score for Ant-Man. I love how modern it sounded. Sammy Sheldon, Wendy M. Craig, and Danny Molaschi's costume designs are wonderful for Ant-Man, Yellowjacket, and The Wasp's designs. Everyone's regular clothes look natural and fitted for them. All the make-up looked great too! In all, Ant-Man does not feel 117 minutes long at nearly two hours, but closer to like watching Paul Rudd and his friends joke around for 20 minutes. Ant-Man is worth watching and is a new favorite upper tier Marvel movie for me.",31-Jan-22,4,0.074,0.616,0.31,0.9999,,,,,,

The chemistry between Scott and Hank is well written and displayed throughout the film, that their relationship and understanding of each other grows. There are no leaps of faith in the actual writing either, the only downside of this movie would be the villain Darren Cross comes off as completely generic, and as a result scene with him end up bringing down the movie. Ant-Man is one of the few Marvel movies that can stand on its own.

And of course it ends like all Marvel origin stories do, the hero must fight the bad guy with the same powers who for no reason is better at using them despite having them for less time for the first half of the fight until it is time for them to lose in a 100% CGI slugfest with no blood or weight to the action.",12-Oct-21,4,0.26,0.565,0.175,-0.9484,,,,,,

Unlike the other superheroes of the MCU, Ant-man doesn't take himself so seriously, he doesn't believe much in himself, he's not a braggart, he's an ordinary person who happens to be a superhero for a series of events, and we like that. very very much. Michael Peña (Luis) is wonderful, the interpretation of him is exceptional. An acting professional who makes you understand how even a secondary character can become the protagonist if well interpreted. The film is exciting, funny and original, there are some little things that could have been done better, (such as the character of ""Ghost girl"" which was not very thorough) but overall it is a film that I always look at with great pleasure .",12-Aug-21,5,0.023,0.794,0.183,0.9691,,,,,,

One might argue that Spider Man: Homecoming was too light as well, but its narrative was able to amp up the tension for the moments that had consequences, but this movie feels too much like a bunch of people were having fun. It's hardly the worst MCU film, but it's easily one of the least memorable; some you remember more because of how bad some elements were, but this simply just doesn't have enough to fully commit to memory long-term. The climax involving the assistance of ants and using toys as intense ballistics is quite entertaining, however.

Andy S,"I see Edgar Wright's humor is well in effect. When Luis said, ""Well my girl left me, my mom died, and my father got deported… But I got the van!"" I love the setup to this movie, it feels a lot like Spider-Man 1 & 2. I'm digging Michael Douglas' character. Seems like an actual good rich guy. I see this whole yellow jacket project going south really fast. Bro! He turned him into jelly, wiped him up and flushed him down the toilet! Holy shit that's some evil shit. That's so awesome the way they're able to control ants on that scale through thought and the device behind their ear. The humor in this movie is top-tier and the special effects and CGI are incredible. Paul Rudd is perfect for this role. He really brings the laughs with his impeccable comedic timing. T.I. was surprisingly funny as well, he's got the chops for it. All the micro visuals were incredibly done. I've never felt bad for an ant dying until I saw Antony get blown away. RIP. Where'd they get that technology that blew up the lab?! That was most definitely an implosion. The ideas in this movie were brilliant! So clever. That scene when they're fighting inside the suitcase and The Cure song plays was poetic, beautiful. Dude those molecular visuals at the end were incredible. Reminded me of the visuals in Doctor Strange when he's going through the different dimensions. You can see Edgar Wright's humor all over this movie and I love it. Especially with the quick jump cuts whenever Luis is explaining how he got the information for the job, reminds me of Shaun of the Dead. Super fun and super entertaining with some brilliant ideas.

Cailan D,"After recovering from a shaky scene after the credits, Ant-Man becomes a mostly enjoyable film, led by a strong and charming performance from Paul Rudd. His charisma and chemistry with the other characters carries a lot of scenes and injects some funny moments into the film. This is a (fittingly) small scale heist movie with big repercussions that actually works, and shows that Marvel is expanding its comfort zone in terms of genres. The action is decent but it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by other MCU installments. Anthony Mackie is nicely worked into the story and is a welcome appearance in the film, and his presence allows the movie to be connected to the Avengers franchise without spending too much time on the connection. With that said, the writing and directing are both a bit awkward at times which disrupts the flow of some scenes and just makes them feel a bit weird. The actors do their best to overcome this when it happens and are successful at times, and Peyton Reed does his best as well. Without Paul Rudd, this movie doesn't work, since he brings, as mentioned above, charm and charisma to this movie that it badly needed and allows it work in many instances where it otherwise wouldn't. While Ant-Man doesn't set any gold standards for future Marvel movies, it does way better than it could've and is an interesting piece of genre deviation for the MCU.",21-Jul-21,4.5,0.035,0.784,0.181,0.9916,,,,,,

Nathan D,"Ant-Man is described as a heist movie, yet the only heist happening in this movie is the robbery of any uniqueness and depth. This 2015 Marvel Studios movie tells the story of Scott Long who just gets out of prison only to get thrown into becoming a superhero who can become the size of an ant. This may sound like an amazing adventure, but in the end, it just becomes a to-do list that checks all the boxes without doing anything out of the box. This is very disappointing as this movie comes after some of the more intriguing and exciting Marvel movies. What I think this movie lacks the most is depth. Every plot aspect in Ant-Man feels glossed over with no real effect to the overall story. Evangeline Lilly's character, Hope Pym, is poorly written and does hardly anything except complain and whine about not being able to wear the suit. In the post-credits, when she does get the Wasp suit, it feels unearned as her character really didn't do anything unique or outstanding to earn it. This is all disappointing because Lilly does a great job in this movie and has some great acting scenes despite her poorly written character. Speaking of the writing, this movie makes a lot of weird choices. The romance between Scott and Hope feels like it came out of nowhere and that the writers just put it in the movie so they could check off the romance box on their list. The comedy in this film is also a little rough as I think some parts take away from the heart of this movie. For instance, when Hank was retelling the story of how Janet went into the Quantum Realm, it felt impactful and was very touching. Then Scott had to ruin the moment with a joke which wasn't funny. Another major thing that bothered me in this movie was the categorization of this film as a heist movie. This is one of the worst heists I have ever seen in any form of entertainment. The montage where Scott, Hank, and Hope discuss the plan is bland and doesn't have that anticipation factor that gets you excited for the plan to be executed. The final heist at Cross Technologies feels so slow with barely any movement or exciting things happening that I don't think you could call this a heist. It doesn't help that the editing is poorly done with quick scene changes that should have gone on longer just so a bad joke could take up that screen time. Plus, the VFX is a bit choppy at times which can take you out of the zone the movie is trying to put you in. These problems could have been caused by the delayed production, multiple rewrites, and it is done 4 days before its world premiere. Despite all the negative aspects of the movie, there are some things to like. For example, I think every actor in this movie does a good job with the roles they are in. Rudd does an awesome job and you can never go wrong with a Michael Douglas performance. I also enjoyed the relationship between Scott and his daughter, Cassie. It felt genuine and made me smile every time the two interacted. Plus, the ""stepfather is the new dad"" trope you see in similar movies was not played up here which was nice to see. Even with these good things in play, I don't think it's enough to help save this movie from all the mistakes it makes. It doesn't help that Peyton Reed doesn't do anything to help elevate this character in any major way. I always wonder what Edgar Wright's vision was before he left due to the differences he and Marvel had. Even though Wright's movie probably wouldn't have fit in the MCU, I am almost positive that it would have been way better than Ant-Man's shallow and bland storytelling.

Jerry S,"Ant-Man was good. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are great together and of course Michael Douglass as Dr. Hank Pym was just perfect casting. But by far the best part of this movie was Louise. I don't know but he is always such a joy to watch. Michael Panea did such a good job to not just improv but also just being a good comic relief. I really need a scene between him, Thor, Peter Quill, and Agatha Harkness. The only problem that I have with this movie is that the science talk is pretty boring. It does take some time to get to the fun stuff of the film, but the science talk does take a tad bit of the fun out of it. While it was important to the story at least I just wish that they could've made it a little more entertaining. However thankfully the second film does a much better job. I really like this movie I know a lot of people really wanted Edgar Wright treatment on the film and me personally I would like to see that as well but honestly I'm satisfied on what we got. 8/10",30-May-21,5,0.027,0.65,0.324,0.9973,,,,,,
Andy S,"Ant-Man is a okay movie. What I really like about this movie is the performance of the actors in this. Not only does the main cast deliver, but also the supporting cast does a phenomenal job.

Puroo R,"When I had heard of Ant-Man for the first time, I couldn't stop laughing. I was imagining Plankton from Spongebob Squarepants in a supervillain costume saying something like ""I am the Ant-Man and I will crush you all!"". So of course you can assume that I didn't know anything about Ant-Man. Rather I was more leaned towards being critical of the movie and the character himself. Later the movie came, I saw he wasn't what I was expecting him to be, and then I was like, ""Okay fine, whatever."". I hadn't watched MCU movies until Infinity War was announced, after which I started bingewatching all the movies. And when it was the turn to watch Ant-Man, I was a bit skeptical. I watched it with a ""Fine, I'll just skim through it like Thor movies."", but it was genuinely so good that I couldn't help but praise it. Ant-Man is a movie, in my opinion, that has taken the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the comedy genre that we know today. It doesn't have those cheap jokes like Age of Ultron, nor the subtle humour like Iron Man movies, but rather it was a complete slapstick comedy that was actually done right. And unlike most superhero comedy movies where the protagonist alone carries the entire sense of humour on his/her own shoulders, in this one it is distributed among all the otehr characters - Scott, Hank, all of Scott's friends, Hope and even Falcon (Ant-Man visits the Avengers HQ in one scene when everyone was out and Falcon happens to catch him). After this movie I learnt about what Ant-Man is about. Apparently both Scott and Hank were Ant-Men in two different eras of the comics. And there are many revelations of Hank being Ant-Man, which is why he has had PTSD about taking the suit again. He is also able to teach Scott how to become Ant-Man on that very basis. Ant-Man's entire training procedure is a bit boring, but occasionally turned interesting because of the exposition. I never thought I'd ever say this, but the exposition scenes of this movie are actually very interesting. The final fight scene of this movie was also very nice. Every time they would show a very intense action scene going on but then cut to real life where it'd be a very small thing. Though I don't understand why were they fighting with the toys, since they are stronger when they are small so the toys shouldn't have affected them much. The scene from the helicopter where Ant-Man would turn small to attack them was also interesting in spite of having a plot hole - why weren't they shooting Ant-Man every time he became bigger? And in the end they manage to make an ant giant, something the movie never tells what happened to it. Speaking of ants, this movie made me see ants very differently. Earlier I just thought them to be miniscule, organised insects who kills bigger and more good looking insects. But now I realised ants actually look pretty cool. We just can't see it because of how small they are, but if we were to tame an ant (for that matter a swarm of them), we could probably use them as a wonderful ally. This movie could be great to tell children how important and interesting ants are. They would probably like them more. Ant-Man is one of the more forgettable movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It serves as a character origin story and is very fun to watch, but now as I write the review 2.5 years later, I have literally no memory of the movie except the scenes I mentioned (and Scott's wife seeing some other man and Ant-Man falling on Stan Lee's car). So I'd definitely give it another watch some day.",8-May-21,5,0.078,0.775,0.147,0.9938,,,,,,

Darren Cross is a generic villain who doesn't really feature enough in the movie to be a main character. Cassie is great and the Final battle scene didn't leave me underwhelmed with some cool scenes with toys flying everywhere and the massive Thomas the Tank Engine.

I wasn't expecting much from it at that point, not that it was necessarily bad or anything but it wasn't what I'd expect from an MCU film. However, positively, it turns into something that fits in this universe. I enjoyed the action, score and humour. The cast do good things, with Paul Rudd filling the titular role nicely. I also really enjoyed Michael Douglas. Evangeline Lilly and Michael Peña are pluses, too. Corey Stoll, meanwhile, is a little meh I will say - entirely passable, but nothing memorable.

Logan C,"Peyton Reed does a fantastic job taking a Marvel movie, that at the time seemed a bit weird to make and creating one of the most lovable characters in the MCU. Paul Rudd is perfect for this role and he makes you feel every emotion he feels. Everything from his motivation to see his daughter, to his confused reactions to discovering the suit is endlessly joyful to watch. The comedy in this movie is a hit almost every time thanks to Paul Rudd and his supporting cast. This movie made me feel a little bad about an ant dying too, which is crazy. The only negative is that the villain is kind of weak to me. His motivation makes sense, but it's just a little cliche. That does not take away from the climax of this movie though.

Tiger P,"Ant-Man is an endlessly fun superhero movie, it's got good action, great acting, and incredibly hilarious writing. Peyton Reed does a fantastic job incorporating some truly funny visual comedy with Ant-Man's shrinking capabilities. The CGI, and actions scenes are surprisingly good, especially when you realize how unique Ant-Man's microscopic power set is, and how hard it might be to make such a thing look compelling. His quippy style of humour is supported by an all-round charismatic cast that plays off each other like nothing else, jumping between Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michael Peña. While there is certainly no lack of plot holes, bad villainy, or mediocre cinematography (outside of action scenes), Ant-Man is still one of my favourite Marvel films, and I do come back to watch it every once in a while. 6.5/10",28-Dec-20,4,0.077,0.661,0.263,0.9826,,,,,,

Evangeline Lilly is good at what she is given, shines when she trains Scoot. And Luizzz is by far steals this movie. I love cuz it is superhero movie with the mix of a heist, the comedy lands and cracks me everytime I watch it. Scoot isn't our everyday superhero, he is complete fraud. He robs, steals. I love his relationship with his daughter, the yound actress playing Cassie is so cute and Scoot doing his best to make her happy sparks little emotion inside me. The villain could have been better. Story is great with Hank mastermining the plan and giving Scoot the mantle. Nice backstory for Hank to later revisit.

David A,"Ant Man, directed by Peyton Reed, was a fun-filled, small scale film, that embraces what it is, for the better. Ant Man, like most MCU films, went through some tough production issues. They initially hired Edgar Wright to direct & write the film, but five rewrites of the script, and some contract disuptes later, Edgar Wright parted ways from the film. Marvel then hired Peyton Reed to direct, and Paul Rudd & Adam McKay to screenwrite. Peyton Reed added in a few decent shots, but this didn't feel like his film; it felt like someone trying to make a film like Edgar Wright, but missed on the execution. If Wright directed & wrote this film, like he should've, this could've easily been one of the MCU's best, having his style and energy pop off the screen. Peyton Reed did a good job with tying the film into the saga, setting up some acceptable, subtle exposition, but this just felt like safe, Marvel factory made film; In some ways, it feels like Peyton Reed borrowed some plot points from the first Iron Man film, and incorporated them here. I appreciated the different approach, going with a heist style film, but Reed spent so much time trying to fit the MCU quota, he wrapped himself into, too many underdeveloped subplots and characters, with an overwhelming barrage of jokes. The narrative has a nice fun tone for the majority of the time, but when they try for that menacing tone, it's laughable, and when they try for that emotional tone, it's too forceful. The pacing of the film isn't balanced well at all. Each act had a different pace, making the film feel not as cohesive as it should be. With a concept that's been used and abused, in order to get people in the seats, you need to have a likable cast; If you have even one character that doesn't work, the film will slowly deteriorate. Sarah Finn casted a lot of likable, and respected actors, but some of the characters didn't pay off as well as expected. Paul Rudd does such a good job in his role as Scott Lang/Ant Man. He brings this undeniable charm and likability to the character, with fantastic delivery to all of his lines, making it real easy to be invested in him. His character arch may be cliche, but he is going to be a nice addition to the avengers team. Evangeline Lilly puts a nice performance as Hope van Dyne, being a nice compliment to everyone on screen. She didn't have a whole lot to do in this film, being purposely shadowed, so it brings a nice edge to her character for the next film. Michael Douglas, man, that man is an actor! He fits the MCU scheme like a glove, putting on the best performance of the whole cast. Although his character has a few likabilities, and noble traits, he was underdeveloped for the amount of spotlight he had; it took some of the fame away from Scott Lang, and he needed all the spotlight he could get. Scott Lang's friends in Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I, are super annoying! McKay and Rudd try to give them enough to do to make them relevant, but they're just useless. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket, is one of the worst, and most forgettable villains of the MCU. The small amout of potential his character had, was washed away by the way his character was written. They tried to give him a back story, but it was so forceful, and underdeveloped, leaving him to be a one dimensional villain. For a phase two film, there really wasn't a lot of action, but when it was there, it was presented in such a visually interesting way, with seamless effects, and so many colors blasting off the screen! You can tell that, before leaving, Edgar Wright choreographed most of the sequences, having his style all over it! Overall, Ant Man is another one of those films, where it's fun to revisit, but it's not one of those stand-out films, that belong at the top of the MCU list.",17-Jun-20,3.5,0.047,0.766,0.187,0.9988,,,,,,

Sarvesh A,"This movie is okay. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. I think some people hate the Ant-Man movies just because they come right after the big team up ones and are small scale, but that's the point. Something doesn't have to be big scale to be good. Ant-Man tells a good story about an ex-con who wants nothing more than to be a part of his daughters life, and it looks at the world of superheroes from the perspective of a normal guy. Paul Rudd is so charming in this role, that you cant help but like the character. Scott Lang is easily one of the most likable characters. But this move does have its flaws, and many of them. Namely, the villain. Yellow Jacket is quite a boring villain. He doesn't even have much of a built up conflict with Scott, his conflict is more focused on Hank. His conflict with Hank was that he thought that Hank didn't trust him enough to show him the Ant-Man suit. Cross was kinda a boring generic businessman that they made a bad guy because he wanted to make money by selling very dangerous technology. He is compelling in no way, and at then end, he just wants to destroy Scott because he suddenly decided he wants to be evil, and there is no buildup to that. Ant-Man is not aiming to be the biggest, best, and most amazing movie ever, its just trying to tell a story about a guy that was released from jail. It may have its flaws, but it works for what it is.",2-Jun-20,3.5,0.189,0.701,0.11,-0.9776,,,,,,

To be honest, I expected more from this film, especially since Marvel hired Edger Wright to originally direct this movie. But Marvel does not like someone trying to ""ruin"" their franchise. Anyway, the jokes were average, the CGI looks perfect, and Michael Douglas steals the show. Micheal Pena, however, really annoys me big time. Overall, Ant-Man is a decent take about Scott Lang being a super hero. If only Edger Wright had directed this movie, I would have give his movie a better score.

Fred P,"Judd Apatow's boring version of Out of Sight. What could have been a neon noirish, twisted, heisty, unique Edgar Wright affair has ended up as a bland, rote, by-the-numbers, cliche, wasteful entry. Yes it's funny, but I mean even Thor 2 was funny. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast and it's about damn time he got some acclaim worthy of his every look and twist of phrase. Pena is a delight to be sure as well and even the criminally underused Corey Stoll is welcome. Some standout moments and comedic turns and sequences and set-pieces are a clever use of Ant-Man, however it plays everything too safe, doesn't revel in the archetypes or tropes of the heist genre as it should and instead abandons the language of those films and sticks to the even play of Marvel's homogenous family. Fully rubbery CGI third act is the bane of these cheap entries (Deadpool I'm looking at you). And the logic is a bit jumpy and montagey and relies on suspension of disbelief, but after Ant-Man's gigantically exciting and pivotal action role in Civil War, I could stand to see a bit more.",18-Feb-20,3.5,0.069,0.698,0.232,0.9903,,,,,,

Matthew D,"Absolutely amazing Ant-Man antics and innovative science-fiction! Director Peyton Reed's superhero science-fiction comedy Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) is just as hilarious and creative as Ant-Man. Reed's direction makes great use of his villain Ghost's phasing in and out of reality alongside Ant-Man and the Wasp's shrinking powers. The final battle is as creative and clever as any Marvel encounter. I love Peyton Reed's Ant-Man movies as he directs character driven storytelling with intimate drama and cute romance. The way Reed brings high concept sci-fi to life with the Quantum Realm is surreal and has Marvel's greatest visuals and CGI besides Doctor Strange. From colorful worlds outside of time, shrinking cars and buildings, to drumming ants, Ant-Man and the Wasp really has it all in terms of striking and playful visuals. I'm so glad producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige allowed Peyton Reed to do what he wants as he runs the gambit of new ideas for Ant-Man to mess around with in Reed's phenomenal Ant-Man and the Wasp. Writers Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, and Gabriel Ferrari came up with very funny jokes, pleasant vibes, and uplifting messages. Ant-Man and the Wasp's themes of fatherhood, motherhood, love, trust, friendship, change, forgiveness, and ethics. I love their surreal science-fiction ideas about The Quantum Realm, time travel, matter phrasing, body enlargement, building shrinking, and molecular state stabilizing. I appreciate how seriously they figured out all this fictional science with real scientific terms and logic. The way these brilliantly innovative writers play around with these concepts through Ant-Man's powers. The Ghost plotline is as thoughtful as the Quantum Realm one mixed in with Scott Lang's house arrest subplot. It's a blast of multiple storylines. Editors Craig Wood and Dan Lebental use all these fast cuts of Wasp switching between human and wasp sizes in fights around the restaurant and van chase sequences. I'm amazed by the final fight between The Ghost against Ant-Man and the Wasp. Wood and Lebental know exactly when to transition in their montages and scenes between Ant-Man or Wasp's perspectives, so that we always feel engaged within scenes in equal time between Marvel's hero and heroine. Cinematographer Dante Spinotti's shots use inventive framing and multiple perspectives for Ant-Man and the Wasp's stunning cinematography. Every wide shot of Hank Pym's lab shrinking or growing is breathtaking. I loved how Spinotti's medium and close-up shots always feel emotionally in tune with Reed's characters. Paul Rudd is so charming, endearing, and hilarious as Scott Lang the Ant-Man. Rudd's Lang feels like the kindest and most fun dad ever with an easy going personality and positive attitude that's fun to watch. Rudd is always funny and surprisingly cool as the skilled improviser Ant-Man. Paul Rudd really is a fantastic Avenger. Evangeline Lilly is gorgeous and awesome as Wasp. Her fights as Wasp are so creative, intense, and varied. Lilly is a lovely love interest for Rudd as they have a cute innocent romantic chemistry. I like how Hope van Dyne just wanted to be invited to fight alongside Ant-Man by Scott Lang during Civil War and that's all she was really upset about in the start. I want more of Paul Rudd's Scott Lang and Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne's adorable romantic comedy and tender romance drama from Ant-Man and the Wasp. Michael Peña's Luis babbles incessantly much to my delight. His endless stories and concerned faces are very funny. He even gets a cool fast car chase sequence. T.I. has this lackadaisical persona as Dave that's quite funny, especially opposite David Dastmalchian's paranoid Russian Kurt. Walton Goggins is fun as this sleazy Southern gentleman villain black market merchant Sonny Burch. Judy Greer's sweet Maggie is funny as she is indignant about the FBI raiding Scott's home. Bobby Cannavale's police officer Paxton is a supportive husband and funnily defends the FBI's invading rights. Hannah John-Kamen's sympathetic antagonist Ava Starr is breathtaking and moving. I love her Ghost character's strange powers that are totally unique to Ant-Man's universe. Her passionate dialogue delivery is gripping alongside Ghost's sudden appearances. I would love to see Hannah John-Kamen return as Ava Starr the Ghost. Abby Ryder Fortson is cute and fun as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie, who wants to grow up to be Wasp. Randall Park's cavalier FBI agent Jimmy Woo is rather endearing and funny. I'd be happy to see him return. Michael Douglas steals every scene as the stern genius Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man. Douglas' flippant disdain for Scott Lang's jokes and flirting with his beloved daughter Hope. Michelle Pfeiffer is emotionally compelling as the first Wasp and Hope's lost mother Janet van Dyne. Laurence Fishburne is intelligent, sly, and intriguing as the thoughtful Dr. Bill Foster the Goliath. Comedian Tim Heidecker's whale tour guide cameo is hilarious just like Gregg Turkington's cameo from the first Ant-Man. Stan Lee's cameo as a former hippie is very funny. Production designer Shepherd Frankel created a fancy set and high tech lab for Hank Pym. The Ghost's manor is very pretty too, just like Scott Lang's warm house set. Set decorators Gene Serdena, Dean Wolcott, Tammy S. Lee, Jeff Markwith, Christopher J. Wood, Tyler Wallace, Jenny Sandell, Daniela Medeiros, Vincent Bates, Colton Comans, Patrick Dunn-Baker, Sam Carter, Terry Hill, Scott Johnson, Blade Ladish, A.J. Caulfield, Gregg Perez, Katie Childs, A.J. Austin, Molly Ebner, Duncan Fletcher, Robbie Sammons, Christian Hoobyar, and Stewart D. Allen furnishes Lang's cozy home and Pym's Quantum laboratory with cute furniture and tons of scientific gear for realism. Art directors Domenic Silvestri, Michael E. Goldman, Clint Wallace, Jay Pelissier, Susan Alegria, Calla Klessig, Rachel Block, Andy Chung, Mari Lappalainen, Kiel Gookin, Julian Scalia, Margaux Wilcox, and Colleen Larson outdid themselves for The Quantum Realm's artful scenes like the stylish shots for Ant-Man's transformations. Costume designers Louise Frogley and Valerie White's superhero uniforms for Ant-Man, Wasp, and The Ghost are super cool and stylish. You can immediately tell them apart even in motion. Make-up artists Valli O'Reilly, Heba Thorisdottir, Björn Rehbein, Jillian Erickson, Seidah Nichols, and Hil Cook give Evangeline Lilly and Hannah John-Kamen an ethereal look. Composer Christophe Beck's score combines melodic symphonies and pulsing electronic synths for Ant-Man and the Wasp. Ant-Man's theme song is triumphant as is Wasp's theme. I love how sound mixers have the music fade in and out during dramatic cues. Sound designers David Farmer, Tom Johnson, Shannon Mills, Juan Peralta, Lee Gilmore, Addison Teague, Douglas Murray, Katy Wood, and Steve Orlando use all manner of noises and sound effects for the body transformations and matter shifting. Everything sounds just otherworldly enough to let you know how unusual Ant-Man abilities are among the Avengers. In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp immediately jumps up to one of my favorite Marvel movies. The frenetic action, stunning CGI, endearing characters, quaint jokes, and crafty science-fiction ideas are something else.",7-Feb-22,2.5,0.053,0.707,0.24,0.9998,,,,,,

The movie is good enough to watch it a Sunday afternoon with your little nephew, but it felt like a wasted opportunity, Marvel could have actually build a good story instead of only using this movie as a bridge for Avengers Endgame.",16-Jan-22,2.5,0.157,0.759,0.084,-0.8413,,,,,,

I didn't hate it by any means, but I found the first Ant Man to be a semi-inconsequential entry to the MCU, and this sequel is the exact same thing, only doubly-so. Again, there's a lot more bickering between the two main heroes than there needs to be, the Wasp being a character that is often times just abrasive and needlessly mean-spirited, and there are random shifts from action to comedy that are extremely jarring as neither the action nor comedy work. And while the first movie did have some genuine heart involving our main hero's broken family, all of that is removed in favor for just ""more comedy"" (a shame as the comedy is so bad). The climax, at least, does have some engaging moments, but this feels too-little/too-late, as the movie felt like it did nothing but meander the entire runtime leading up to it. None of the characters are engaging, only our main hero is charismatic, and the villains are entirely unmemorable.

There are so many plot holes, movie tropes and failed attempts at humour that unfortunately Marvel's first film showcasing a female hero in the title falls flat.

michael l,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is another uncommon instance where the sequel does better than its predecessor, in this case much better as with Winter Soldier. The script, directing and action are all big improvements from Ant-Man 1. The issues with awkward dialogue and scene continuity are all but gone in this sequel which makes the movie flow much more smoothly and be a lot more entertaining. The great chemistry between Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly only adds to this, giving the movie the same if not more charm and charisma than the first one had. It's also nice that the movie gives some context for Hope's mother that was touched on in the first movie but not explored very much, which it does in its first scene. The opening scene of AMatW is way better than the one of its predecessor and allows the movie to hit the ground running. AMatW is also much funnier than Ant Man 1 because of the better scripting and chemistry of the actors. The villains in this movie aren't the most convincing ones and don't pose too much of a threat or raise the stakes terribly high, but that's a bit of a nice feeling since this movie came out a bit after Infinity War did. That is the best part about AMatW: it's a nice palate cleanser for fans coming off the heels of Infinity War and gives us something (appropriately) smaller scale to feast on. Overall, AMatW is a breath of fresh air for Marvel fans, a big step up from its predecessor and a solid and entertaining entry in the MCU.",23-Jul-21,4,0.104,0.717,0.179,0.9703,,,,,,
Nathan D,"This sequel takes everything from the first movie and makes it more fun. While there are still flaws with this film, there is much more to like about it. One of the best things about this movie is the comedy. The comedy in the first movie was very annoying and ruined a lot of great moments. However, in this movie, the comedy compliments the story greatly and gives it more personality. The writing overall is much better. Yes, there were still some parts of the story that could have been worked with a bit more, but I think this movie felt more full than its predecessor. The story overall was quite nice and it had more depth to it, but the aspect of explanation was just not present. For example, the process of extraction and why Janet would be affected by Ghost's actions was poorly explained. Also, the explanation of Walton Goggins's Sonny Burch is just awful. Honestly, that whole storyline just takes up screen time. Goggins does an ok job in the role, but I don't think he's the one to blame as his whole story is so terribly written that you will forget he is even in the movie. The filmmakers were better off creating a whole new character instead of using a character from the comics who doesn't even do anything important. As for the other characters and their personalities, most of them were spot on. Although, I did have a slight problem with how a few of the characters were written. For instance, I found Scott to be a bit more selfish this time and care a bit less about his actions. His constant complaints about getting home before the FBI showed up got annoying really fast. The other character that I think needed a bit more work was Hope Pym. Evangeline Lilly did great in this role and her persona was definitely fixed in the sequel, but I still found her to be a bit whiny and conserved. All and all, everyone, including Rudd and Lilly, did such a great job and is always a joy to see on screen. Another thing that I was so happy to see was the quality get much better in this movie than in the first. Ant-Man felt cheap and didn't have that grand MCU film. On the other hand, Ant-Man and The Wasp looked amazing and the VFX were so much better. It was so cool to look at Ghost when she phased and Hannah John-Kamen did a great job with the different expressions in each one of her phases. Another thing that was very fun to watch was the changes in size from our two leads. The school scene in particular was very fun and a highlight of the movie for me. It had great lines from both Rudd and Lilly, amazing VFX work, and just that overall charm that I would expect from an Ant-Man and The Wasp movie. Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a fun movie that I think had a lot of potential. There are some flaws here and there, but you will be entertained through most of the movie. Peyton Reed does a better job here and I think he will do even better in Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania which sure to be a fun time.

Andy S,"This was much better than the first movie. The first movie introduced to us the Quantum Realm and now we are really given a deep dive to the Quantum Realm. We're seeing a lot more of it and exploring it for the sake for Avengers: Endgame. The movie is at its best when it's exploring this Realm. It just really interested me and I honestly really had a lot more fun around this one than the first one. However the only problem that I have with this movie is Ghost. I get what they were going for here but I didn't really care for her story that much. I feel like it would've been better if she had more time in the film or given a Disney+ series of her own to flesh out her story more. However even though she was the weakest part of the film, that doesn't mean she doesn't have her perks. Ghost is at her best when she does her action scenes. I really love how she fazes in and out and does get pretty creative when she fights Ant-Man in the pick- up truck. Now that the bad stuff is out of the way let's get on with the stuff that I like. I really like the chemistry between all of the heroes as always, and the one that I really like the most is the relationship between Dr. Hank Pym and Dr. Bull Foster. I don't know what it is there relationship just really interest. Me and I really like their history. Even though that the movie talked more than showed U was still really interested in their past and I would honestly like to see more of their history in a Disney+ series. However the one element that I really like in the movie is the relationship between Janet Van-dyne. This for me was the highlight of the movie. I just thought that the stuff between Hope, Scott, Dr Pym and his wife was really heartwarming. I just really enjoyed the chemistry between them and it actually really made me care about their relationship more. Another highlight is of course Randall Park in this movie was awesome. This movie while flawed is still good I enjoy watching this movie and for what it's worth it's solid fun. 8.8/10",30-May-21,4,0.057,0.693,0.25,0.9983,,,,,,

Puroo R,"I watched this movie as a part of my marathon to see all the MCU movies after Infinity War came up. Technically Infinity War was as far as I was going to have my marathon, but by the time I reached that point, this movie had also come out. So I saw this also. It felt a bit out of place considering there were two very heavy movies one after another (Black Panther and Infinity War), because of which it looked like a balloon compared to those anvils. But at the same time it was at least better than Captain Marvel so it gets some browny points from my side. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a very hilarious movie to say the least. I just love how the Ant-Man series always shows things to look very dramatic when they are tiny but they are actually very miniscule events when it happens in the real size. There are many emotional scenes too, as the premise of this movie is entirely about Scott trying to find the Janet, Hank's wife whom he presumed dead after all these years since they last went on a mission together. The very beginning of the movie itself begins from an emotional scene with little Hope saying her final goodbye to her mother. She is occasionally contacted by a ghost as a part of her dreams, which later turns out to be her mother. Meanwhile Scott has been put under house arrest for being on Captain America's side in Civil War. So he has to manage looking like he's at home while he's out there saving the day. I really liked how the bad guys literally steal Hank's office by just shrinking it, picking it up and walking away. The bad guys are also comical, especially the Indian one who says ""This is not truth serum! There is no such thing as a truth serum!"". The comedy scenes in the movie completely outshine the sad scenes, which I can say with a guarantee since I watched this movie 2 years ago and I only remember the good parts of it. There are of course a couple of things I didn't really like in this movie. First of all, the regular MCU problem - a dozen jump cuts in every fight scene. Why do they have to do this? All the fight scenes would havelooked not just cool, but even iconic if they didn't do that. Secondly even the dire moments get overshadowed by the funny moments when they don't have to be. Like when Hope finally meets Janet there is a joke immediately after. I get the movie is trying to keep the ""Ant-Man"" touch to it constantly, but this is going too far. And lastly, the post credit scene was so awesome, but it got ruined in Endgame. I know it's not this movie's fault but rather Endgame's fault for doing that, but these movies were planned together so if they knew this would have such an anticlimactic end they shouldn't have done it. I can absolutely guarantee you that Ant-Man and the Wasp will only leave you with good memories. There is no absolutely bad thing that happens in it, and it manages to retain the humour, cinematography and sotryline that one would expect from a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.",28-Apr-21,5,0.124,0.737,0.139,0.8733,,,,,,

It's the MCU's weakest film, up until this point at least, so far. I rate the 2015 film quite a bit, it's entertaining and something different, but this sequel kinda felt flat to me for the majority. There's marginally enough there to like though. Paul Rudd is satisfactory as the lead, while Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña remain as solid as before. Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne are cool additions, but I can't say their characters are all that memorable - still passable, mind you. The action is the film's biggest plus. The shrinking stuff always looks good, too. The humour is at a suitable level. Overall, it's an OK watch.",23-Jan-21,4,0.028,0.759,0.213,0.9816,,,,,,
Brady L,"Marvel continues to churn out great movies with characters from the comic books we are only somewhat familiar with. This action packed movie brings the Wasp into the MCU fully. While this is happening concurrently with the events of Infinity War, we do not see any mention of anything happening anywhere else in the world. Would have made sense to see the alien ship over New York popping up on a news station at some point. Also, I did not feel like there was a true villain to this film. Ghost is simply wanting to live her life pain-free, Burch is a nuisance and Foster is jealous of Hank's success. The stakes are there with the whole FBI integration in the film, but they are so unbelievably terrible at their jobs that I never once believed they could catch a cold let alone Lang. Why didn't you bug the house with cameras and microphones everywhere. The ankle bracelet doesn't seem to work the way they want it to. This movie is a ton of fun, good laughs, great action sequences and we get more innovative sizing scenarios in this film. Adding Michelle Pfeiffer to the MCU, allowing her to join an exclusive club of actors in both DC and Marvel films, was a welcome addition, she will definitely make an amazing Janet Pym.

Alef M,"Acharam o tom perfeito aqui Lembro de ter quase dormido no primeiro filme, pois ele estranhamente parecia ""carregado"". Aqui, a dinâmica ocorre de uma maneira bem diferente. O humor é bem dosado, surpreendendo quando pensamos em levar a serio e em momentos cringe - como de costume. As cenas de ação tem uma criatividade satisfatória, se mesclando muito bem com o humor visual, como o Scott montando num caminhão e o usando de patinete. Como eu disse acima, a dinâmica do grande e pequeno foi muito bem aproveitada. É claro que o filme não se leva a serio, mas a reação da mãe ao ser resgatada me pareceu fora da realidade até mesmo pra um filme como esse. Fora alguns Deus ex Machina inexplicáveis. Porém, como o filme me divertiu muito, mesmo assistindo pela segunda vez, devo dizer que minha atenção para com esses ""erros"" não passaram de detalhes. Eu me diverti muito e é isso que importa.

Ted W,"( warning, this movie contains massive spoilers) Great fantastic phenomenal hilarious movie starring paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, micheal Pena, Michael Douglas, and Michelle Pfeiffer. This movie isn't as good as the original ant man but still a really enjoyable time for the family. This movie has a ton of jokes. It's very rare for me to laugh in any film especially in theaters. This movie's jokes are the best jokes of a marvel movie. This and Thor fragglerock are hilarious. The villian in this film is mediocre at best. If you thought the first film had a bad villian, nope, this villian is way worse because the villian isn't really the villian or the good guy, just another character in the mix but maybe she'll be useful in future marvel movies. Now for the good. All the characters are cool as always and hope is way bettet in this than in the first movie. Ant man is the same, still cool and the whole cast is stacked. The story is cool and how it effects the Marvel universe is really fascinating but if you're just starting out in the Marvel universe then I can see how someone could not like this movie.

Sarvesh A,"I think this movie is overly hated, simply because it came after Infinity War. That doesn't make the movie worse. If anything, its a breath of fresh air. Infinity War was the biggest superhero movie ever made thus far, and so returning to a normal story on the ground was not a bad idea. Unfortunately, Ant-Man and the Wasp was not as effective as the first one was. While the villains are significantly better, they still aren't that good. Ghost was a bit wasted. She had the potential to be a great villain but they spent too much time on Sonny Burch, who was a generic arms dealer and not good at all. The humor does not land as well as it did in the original Ant-Man. The relationship between Hank, Hope, and Scott is handled well, and Paul Rudd is as perfect for the role as ever, but the story overall just isn't that interesting. There is also a lot less of Luis's fantastic storytelling abilities. Also the stakes in the final battle were incredibly low. This could work, if it is small and personal, like it was in Spider-Man: Homecoming, but it didn't here, because the hero and villain had no connection. This movie doesn't deserve the hate that it gets, but it isn't great.",24-Jun-20,3.5,0.165,0.649,0.186,0.8631,,,,,,

Hayden L,"Ant Man and the Wasp, directed by Peyton Reed, again, did everything you would expect in a sequel, but everything was very messy, forgettable and underwhelming. Ant Man and the Wasp didn't feel all that necessary to begin with; It strictly feels like a filler film, creating exposition for what's to come. The premise of the film is all over the place, trying to equally divide the importance, resulting in a repetitive, jumbled and cluttered narrative. The plots were extremely silly, while creating a few subplots, and plot holes . Reed and the creative team went for that small scale, light-hearted attempt again, but due to the small amount of tension, with the film being lazily crafted, the story fell flat! Ant Man and the Wasp had the best potential with developing, and introducing new characters, but due to the terrible writting, this film felt very crowded, and underdeveloped. Surprisingly, Evangeline Lilly as Wasp, was the star of this film! She was allowed a lot more character moments, compared to last time, where she was sidelined, and almost caged-in. Even though she isn't one of the most interesting characters the MCU has to offer, she is an investable character, because of her decently written back story, and motive. Paul Rudd had great potential to be developed nicely, after being introduced in such a likable way, but his character arch of the film, throws off his character for me. His character wasn't written as good as the first film, feeling like there was some conflicting opinions on the screenwriters side. His character was more or less, pushed to the side, to let Evangeline Lilly shine. The favorable, Michael Douglas returns as Hank Pym, but he really doesn't have that much to do in this film; he kind of just stands in the background, throwing his wit out there, here and again. Michael Pena, T.I, and David Dastmalchian return as their respective characters, and they're even worse than the first installment. They don't do much at all; they only cause more plot holes to arise. Abby Ryder Fortson is fine as Cassie, having this beautiful bond with Paul Rudd, while getting a little bit more to do this time around, but she still is strictly used as a plot device. As for the villains of the film, every single one of them are disposable! Laurence Fishburne is such a useless, predictable character, that adds no merit to the film, whatsoever. Walton Goggins runs the same lines as Fishburne, probably having even less to do, being severely underdeveloped. If you were to scratch the both of them, this film would not change. Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, had a lot of potential, but they took a lot of focus off of her, and tried to equally spread it, so it made her character go brutally underdeveloped. It's sad to say that her character is completely forgettable because, the Ghost character has a lot of cool aspects, that could've been included. The screenplay by Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, and Gabriel Ferrari, was very sloppy! They tried to do what every sequel does, and crank every aspect up a level, but they missed in every category. They tried to be way too smart with the science of everything, creating many plot holes, and stuff that just doesn't add up. The comedy of the film had a few okay moments, but it was really distracting overall, taking away a lot from what could've been captured. With a film like Ant Man, the opportunity for the action sequences to be great, are extremely high, but this film did not execute on that. Peyton Reed struggled to find a sense of style, creating these just subpar action scenes. The effects of the film were fine for the most part, but there are some moments were you can clearly tell they're using CG or a green screen. Overall, I feel like it's fair to say that Ant Man and the Wasp is one of, if not, the worst film of the Infinity Saga; completely lacking in every opportunity they had, that was handed to them on a silver platter.",22-Jun-20,3.5,0.081,0.774,0.145,0.9943,,,,,,
Eric L,"The first ANT-MAN film turned out to be a surprise hit, especially considering that the original director attached to the project, the enormously talented Edgar Wright (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, BABY DRIVER) was replaced by the rather mundane Peyton Reed (BRING IT ON, YES MAN). However, helped by the extremely likable Paul Rudd as the shrinking hero, and an equally inspired cast (lead by Michael Douglas as Hank Pym-who bore none of the stigma of the comic's version of the character, Evangelyne Lilly as his daughter Hope Van Dyne, and the scene-stealing trio of David Dastmalchian, T.I. and Michael Peña), the film amassed over half a billion at the world box office, and introduced a charismatic new hero to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While certainly not an auteur, Peyton Reed nonetheless directed a highly enjoyable and entertaining flick. At the end of the first film, Michel Douglas' Hank Pym shows his daughter Hope a super-suit he has been working on for her. ‘' About damn time!'' she exclaims, expressing both the views of comic book fans eager to see the Wasp on the big screen, and also decrying the sad fact that movie superheroes is still mainly a boy's club that can benefit from a bit of estrogen. As promised, she shares top billing in this year's sequel ANT-MAN AND THE WASP, and proves herself, as was hinted in the original film, a formidable ally to the occasionally hapless Rudd. All the original cast is back, with the addition of Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, Hannah John-Kamen as the troubled foe ‘'Ghost'', and Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Bill Foster in a cool homage to 1975's BLACK GOLIATH. Pretty much like THE INCREDIBLES 2, ANT-MAN AND THE WASP is fast-paced, funny and light, which is a welcome change after the dread that permeated AVENGERS INFINITY WAR. Needless to say, we can expect Ant-Man to appear in the next chapter in the Thanos saga, creating an almost complete reunion of the comic book founding members of the Avengers (Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Ant-Man and The Wasp). My only beef with the film is in a script that can occasionally be lazy, in particular with a fairly irritating Deus Ex Machina at the end of the film, in a scene that too conveniently collides two story lines into a rather unbelievable conclusion. It's nowhere near bad enough to make the rest of the film lose its appeal, but it is one hell of an eye-roller.",20-Jun-20,3.5,0.073,0.813,0.114,0.8182,,,,,,

Elliot M,Ant-Man and the Wasp is one of the MCU movies that doesn't really work but the cast makes it work.

Christopher D,"By today standards, this movie is pretty much the baseline of superhero movies and blockbuster sequels. It is entertaining, has some nifty action scenes (most of which we're shown a lot of in the trailers) and the witty cast offers up a decent dose of laughs (Michael Pena for the win again). At the same time, the whole movie just feels bland all around. It goes bigger but feels smaller (not in a good way). While this is meant to be a lighthearted action comedy like the first one, it lacks the freshness and inventive energy of its predecessor simply because filmmaker Edger Wright didn't have any influence on this follow-up like before. As for the villain(s), they are among the dullest in the MCU. The phasing concept of Ghost is fairly cool but the execution of this character's choreography quickly shows itself to be so uninspired while the character herself quickly becomes a forgettable adversary. - 6/10 (C+)",26-Mar-20,4,0.048,0.755,0.197,0.9752,,,,,,

I don't care hwhi is Ant man in the comics, they should just had given the movie to Michael Peña's Latino character Luis, as he is the movie's sole silver lining /saving grace in this and the previous.

Matthew D,"An exciting and more characterized Avengers movie. Director Joss Whedon's superhero sci-fi action-thriller Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) asks what is the price of freedom versus how do we keep people safe as heroes? Whedon's got stylish direction, but the action is hard to follow at times and features less interesting moments than in The Avengers. There's so many plotlines and fights going on simultaneously that the emotional tension gets lost in the chaos. I appreciate Joss Whedon's writing for Ultron as a robot designed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner to bring about world peace, only to want to end The Avengers. The ethics debate about the value of scientific progress versus the potential for danger between Stark and Banner is fascinating. I keep thinking about Ultron's clever dialogue. Whedon advances the character arcs for Iron Man, Black Widow, Hulk, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and gives us Vision all in one movie wherein The Avengers fight Ultron. I did find Whedon's jokes more immature and infantile compared to his wit from The Avengers. It's a lot of compile, so Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek's editing gets confusing with tons of stories getting cut together. It's not as streamlined as The Avengers. Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo are interesting as these brilliant scientists who figure out artificial intelligence. I love their two debates about the need for progress in heroism, so that The Avengers are not necessary forever. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is funny and charming, but wanders off for some strange visions that conveniently inform him of the impending Infinity War. Chris Evans' Captain America still has his morals, patriotism, and insight, but his leadership is undermined by the jokes about his goody-two-shoes personality. Scarlett Johansson is awesome in her acrobatic combat as Black Widow with real emotionally gripping scenes as Natasha Romanoff. Jeremy Renner and Linda Cardellini are wonderful as Hawkeye and his supportive wife. It's nice that Renner gets to act more seriously and is given some motivation to be like a guiding father to the team. James Spader's deep, disaffected voice, rife with sarcasm, as Ultron is creepy. Samuel L. Jackson and Don Cheadle have good advice as Nick Fury and War Machine. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is neat as Quicksilver, but not as charming or funny as Evan Peters in X-Men. Elizabeth Olsen is gorgeous and sincere as Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch. Her powers are incredible and fun to watch unnerve The Avengers and decimate Ultron's robot scores. Paul Bettany is thoughtful and expressive as Vision. Very cool to see another near magic hero. Cobie Smulders is helpful as Maria Hill, but could have had more lines and action. Anthony Mackie is mostly forgotten about as Falcon. Hayley Atwell has a touching cameo during Captain America's visions of what could have been for him. Stellan Skarsgård is basically a cameo. Claudia Kim is great as this genius doctor, who magics up Vision's body. She's very charming. Andy Serkis' Wakandan metal thief is very funny. Julie Delpy is eerie as the woman that forced Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff to be sterilized. Stan Lee's veteran cameo is cute. Josh Brolin finally makes his move as Thanos in the after credits scene. Cinematographer Ben Davis has plenty of gorgeous close-up and medium shots. His wide shots can look cheap here covered in decent CGI. Ultron and Vision look amazing, but Ultron's robots had some cheaper looking shots. The city getting raised up looked like a video game cutscene. I was not crazy about all the Sokovia sets from production designer Charles Wood. It just looks like a generic European city. Same with Oslo, Norway and wherever The Avengers were fighting Ultron in South Korea. Composer Danny Elfman has some nice Avengers themes to his upbeat score with Brian Tyler's music lending a hand as well. I loved Alexandra Byrne's costumes for Black Widow and Scarlet Witch and the rest of the team's uniforms were nice. Age of Ultron does feel its 141 minutes as the confusion can drag the pace down a bit. In all, Age of Ultron is not the best, nor the worst Avengers movie.

Max A,"The core Avengers characters are well established by this time this film was released. The one exception might be Black Widow, she had been left to be mysterious to this point, unfortunately. I appreciated the relationship angle with her and Banner. It gave them both a human touch. I think is was decently executed. Black Widow is wearing a suit enhanced by Stark Industries I'm assuming, thus the additional tech angle to her gagets and attacks. The callbacks to the recruitment of the Avengers and the ending (spoilers) with the ""New Avengers"" was a lot of fun. The scene is set for Civil War with the building conflict in styles and moralities in the team. The creation of Ultron is classic hubris and I loved his reveal at the end of the celebration for capturing Loki's staff. His stumbling 'drunken' demeanor matching the end of party vibe, his ramblings and witticisms refining until his final spoken word is sharp as a knife and his pantomime of humanity is revealed. There are problems a plenty (as usual with a blockbuster MCU superhero movie) with plot holes, plus some spotty CGI during fight scenes, and endless waves of blank targets to mow down.

Also, Thor going after Dr. Erick Selvig to find a magical pound was so weird, we see Thor and the Dr. parting on a car and the next thing we know is they have found this magic pound that we had no idea it existed because it wasn't talked about during the movie. The movie has its good parts too, every time a bunch of superheroes get together to face someone trying to anihilate the human race you know it would be entertaining, but that's it.",9-Jan-22,4.5,0.057,0.882,0.061,0.1728,,,,,,

The music is very good, as always when it comes to the Avengers, the visual effects are incredible, they are one of the few Marvel productions that still have good visual effects. In conclusion, I would say that the criticism that has been given to this film is valid, but it is true that before giving your own opinion you must see it and not let yourself be carried away by that of other people.

Bradley W,"Avengers Age of Ultron is a passable movie, it isn't the best that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer, but it also isn't the worst. There are plenty of great scenes that hold the movie up, but they tend to get pulled down by problems that are the center point of the movie. Ultron is probably one of the weaker villains, when he should be one of the best. Watching the Avengers work together, and banter is still as fun as it was during the first movie, but the charm of the first movie has faded with this one. I can't recommend going back and watching this movie personally, I know that it is a mixed bag as this movie has a lot of fans, I am just not one of them even after a second viewing. The movie isn't bad but is just isn't good either.

Mr F,"I seriously think that the only reason this movie is considered so mediocre is because it's on the same shelf as the legendary Endgame and Avengers: Assemble because this film deserves a lot more praise. The writing is witty and handles all the characters differently but emotionally and mostly in a clever way, with stand out characters being Tony and Wanda but the real pinnacle of the film being Ultron. Much like the movie, the only reason he is not the best villain in marvel is cos we have so many great ones, because Ultron is a hilarious and threatening, well designed marvelous (see what i did there) mix of Tony, Bruce and Vision who has motives that line up with Iron Man's character leeding to real deep dives into the sea of his phyce. The story is mostly simple, with many well choreographed but somtimes boring fight scenes and lot's of exposition but you have to remember that it's introducing three new characters here AND trying to move development on for the Og's. The movie set's up further Marvel movies, like Civil War, and gives our heroes something internal to recon with while still leaving us asking questions that we know will be answered. I don't watch it was much as any of the others because i don't think it does as much fan service and i don't think it's as funny despite it being just as witty as the others.",7-Oct-21,3,0.077,0.746,0.177,0.9829,,,,,,

Cailan D,"Avengers: Age of Ultron unfortunately falls into the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The writing and directing lack the finesse that they had in the first Avengers and are both awkward at times. Ultron, though Spader gives a pretty good performance as him, isn't the greatest villain because it seems that he dislikes the Avengers for reasons that aren't personal to him. He attempts to come off as sort of a ""people person"" but ultimately fails to do so because of his goals and execution. The humor is decent but not as good as it is in other MCU installments and is hampered by the script. The biggest issue of Age of Ultron is that it's a very ambitious film and tries to do too much with its runtime. There are multiple stories going on so as to set up future movies and the movie would've done better with a more specific focus. All that said, the actors as usual do their best to overcome the script and are successful at doing so in many instances. The chemistry between them helps to carry scenes where other elements don't work as well. One highlight of this film is actually one of the low points of the first Avengers, being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. This movie treats him very differently than its predecessor and gives him more screen time and moments to shine. His speech to Wanda during the climatic battle is one of the best speeches in the entire MCU and his arc gives more depth to his character and leaves plenty of opportunities for future development and storytelling. The action sequences are entertaining enough and should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. While Age of Ultron is far from the best the MCU has to offer, it has some redeeming qualities and is worth taking a look at.",20-Jul-21,4.5,0.068,0.757,0.175,0.9931,,,,,,

Puroo R,"After the release of Avengers: Infinity War, I began bingewatching all the MCU movies so that I could catch up in time with Avengers: Endgame. I had heard of Age of Ultron before as I once eavsdropped my classmates when they were talking about it one time. The only thing I knew about this movie was the meme in which Captain America is lifting the Mjolnir. So it'd be pretty much clear to say that I had no idea what I'm about to watch. I watched it with a blank slate. And somehow it managed to be worse than The Avengers in spite of the bigger cast and budget. There are many things I like about this movie, and many things that I absolutely hate. This is probably the only superhero movie I have ever seen in which I like the conversation scenes more than the fight scenes. And that's exactly why this movie is such a mixed bag for me. The cinematography is so good it makes all the previous movies look campy, and the CGI is easily superior to any movie released before this (not just MCU, any movie at all). However, I didn't like the depiction of Ultron. The movie made him look like a total loser. The way Vision just wiped him out in the post credit scene was the last straw for me. The only fight scene I liked in this movie was the one between Iron Man (Hulkbuster) and Hulk, since I hate Hulk and this was finally the point where my favourite hero Iron Man beats him to pulp. Everywhere else I felt like getting in the screen and slapping everyone. Black Widow (bleugh!) and Hawkeye are killing all the Iron Man clones with just a pistol and a bow. Ultron always shows up like he's supposed to be the most powerful creature to ever exist, and then gets whooped and goes away. It completely undermines the threat he is, if it wasn't for the Sokovia scene. Speaking of the Sokovia scene, Quicksilver was the most terrible introduction to any superhero shown in the franchise. The X-Men Quicksilver and the MCU Quicksilver remind me of the Buff Doge vs Crying Cheems meme. His death in Sokovia made me go, ""Oh no! Anyway..."". Wanda was a much better character, but there was no way to tell she's the legendary Scarlett Witch if we don't know about it already. Same could be said about Quicksilver, but Scarlett Witch got a lot better in Captain America: Civil War, which made her redeemable for me. Another thing that annoys me throughout the movie is that Black Widow has finally been reduced to what we always expected Joss Whedon to want her to be - an eye candy. Bruce Banner fell on her in one scene (I feel it's hypocrisy if we only talk about Flash and Wonder Woman but not this) and in one scene she kissed Bruce and then pushed her in a pit so that Hulk comes out. And Hulk is a completely separate entity yet he never seems to harm Natasha, even though he did it once in The Avengers. Avengers: Age of Ultron is like the black sheep of all the Avengers movies. In spite of having huge potentials it simply falls flat in terms of everything. I really like all the characters in their own individual movies and MCU was going so great until this movie came. It's kinda weird The Avengers picked up from The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 yet made them so cool while this picked up from Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier still couldn't live up to their expectations. I'd give it another shot when I have nothing better to do, but until then I'm not gonna be liking it.",16-Jun-21,3.5,0.09,0.808,0.102,0.7951,,,,,,

This film was supposed to be a set up for future films setting up Black Panther, Captain America: Civil War, Black Widow, Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War.

Joss Whedon came back to direct from the first one and made a film that surpasses the original in tone but not in the fun aspect. All the avengers return to combat a new villain called Ultron voiced by the incredible James Spader. The film has a great story centered on the fears and struggles of Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr. as he creates Ultron a robot with intelligence that wants to wipe out humanity. Spader brings his usual personality of sarcasm and wit to Ultron with great results. However, this one fails sometimes to bring in the fun and comedy like the original focusing instead on dark themes that do not always resonate. Some characters are sacrificed for plot such as wanda and pietroff played Aaron taylor johnson and elizabeth olsen.

Arshil J,"""I'm not sure how to feel about this? I'm still processing."" That's how so many felt, myself included, after seeing Infinity War. I always enjoy a good post-film conversation and it's hard to know where to start when so many things you love, even before they were brought to life on the big screen, just… well, I'd rather not say exactly. It's no secret that we lose a lot of characters, or as Disney likes to think of them, franchises. (And I won't get into who, that's spoiler territory that will be discussed on the Film Threat Podcast next week.) But suffice it to say, that this is the first Marvel movie to end… in a way that no one expected. Some are comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back, which ends on a cliffhanger and one really big question. The ending of Infinity War puts beloved characters in a far worse predicament because logically, there is no way to fix this so that our heroes win. (At least knowing all the rules that the Marvel universe has introduced to us.) We've gotten so used to Marvel movies ending with our heroes on the winning side that when that doesn't happen, we really don't know what to think. I do believe some children will be traumatized, probably kids under ten. In fact, I saw a boy about eight years-old walking out of Infinity War at an early screening balling his eyes out. I think some parents might be upset that this might not be an experience for the single-digit aged set. But they're going to have to get over it and perhaps use this as a teaching moment, because in life, we don't always win. More often than not, life is a series of losses followed by a good win every once in awhile. What Marvel has done is subversive in all the best ways. I am just pleased that they continue to surprise us and I for one, cannot wait for the conclusion. Now we all will have to wait a year for the resolution when we learn which characters live and which characters, I mean, actors will ""die,"" meaning their contract to appear in future Marvel movies has not been renewed. If I had to speculate, I would say that while the actors playing certain characters may no longer be with us, those characters may continue with other actors in those roles.

Ryan S,"Cool seeing them all together again, even if I didn't massively enjoy it. It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion. 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned. Robert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either. With that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall.",18-Jan-21,0.5,0.031,0.885,0.084,0.8579,,,,,,

Jonathan K,"While this is hardly the worst big-budget movie I have seen, this might be the single most boring. There are numerous plot threads that take way too long to play out, banter that is well below Buffy/Angel-era Joss Whedon (like he created a formula and now he's out of tricks or wit, even shamelessly stealing the ""Scary version of 'There Are No Strings On Me' from the movie 'Gamer'), and the movie commonly looks like it was shot on an iPhone placed on a tripod. Seriously, next to the non-Snyder half of Justice League (also Whedon), this might be the most plain-looking big-budget movie I've ever seen, with flat camera angles, simple blocking and paint-by-numbers editing. I honestly lost count of how many shots in the movie were clearly instances where Whedon seems to have told the Actor/Actress: ""Just pull a pose and we'll add CGI to make it look like you're using powers and defeating the bad-guys."" Luckily the CGI itself is of pretty good quality, as the CG Artists clearly carried much of this film in terms of the action, as there's almost no momentum in how it was shot or edited outside of the CGI itself. And to top it all off, it all feels so unimportant when all is said and done; Vision is created, sure, Hulk is momentarily gone, and Civil War opted to use the events here as a background catalyst for character motivations, but beyond these it just feels like a movie made because it had been X Years since the previous one, and Whedon was only hired because the first one was (legitimately) good. I've enjoyed a lot of MCU films, myself previously never having been a fan of the genre, but this is one I genuinely have no interest in ever exploring again.

The opening scene is another meaningless action sequence while the dialogue is empty banter intended to build character. But it doesn't. What I discovered is that I just don't care about the Marvel universe or it's heroes. And I don't really mean the superhero, but the person. I enjoyed Jon Favreau's IRON MAN, but I just don't like Tony Stark as a person. I don't care about the relationships. There is nothing compelling about these characters.

Prior to this, I did not sense a buildup to the villain. It sort of came out of nowhere. Also, Tony had learned from his mistakes and is very careful with what he creates. It seemed a little unbelievable to have an AI that RDJ knows is a lot more powerful than Jarvis, untamed and almost free in his lab. Like the other Avengers movies, the cast and acting are great. The action set pieces are memorable and the Climax delivers entertainment. However, I would have liked to see Quicksilver more because I thought the best comedy in this movie, was Hawkeye and Quicksilver bantering at each other.

Matt R,"With such a long runtime, you would expect there to be some level of character development. Of interesting relationships, a good villain with plausible goals, and a plot that seems to deserve almost two and a half hours of your life. But it seems that alas, what we got was, at best, a mediocre redo of the original Avengers. (Spoilers) Basically, there's all these people who have special, magic powers, and while they're off doing their own thing or working together, they bump into an enemy. After failing to beat the enemy the first time, the stakes are higher than ever! Our heroes rush to the scene, and just as it seems like all hope is lost, they prevail! The acting is rubbish if I'm being honest; that's an unpopular opinion, but the truth of the matter is that the characters are not relatable or entertaining, with the exception of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, whose problems are surprisingly interesting to watch play out. But it gets worse. Ultron is a terrible villain. His motives are dumb, because he doesn't have motives. He is simply a corrupted computer-machine-thing that wants to destroy the world or something. He wants to accomplish this by, and this is not a joke, raising up an entire town using rockets, and then dropping it. What? That's the best the writers could do? It's understandable they're trying to be creative and wacky, but this just feels so generic and uninteresting. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be anything particularly special or out of the ordinary about this villain. So you've got a clique story, a clique set of bland, boring characters, and a villain that's just... meh.

E C,"Worst MCU film but by far not even a bad action film Stark motivated by fear creates Ultron. The last living Hydra (until now) creates Wanda & Pietro using Loki's scepter. Nice follow up to previous storylines of solo films. The after party scene with Mjolnir is one of my favourites. This is the reason why I love MCU, the dialogues between the action sequence, character inactions, whips, callbacks. Watch NandovMovies video on this after party sequence. The twins are great, Wanda is flawed with bad past (even more now) and Pietro's dead in my opinion was worth it, at last someone died for real. In real life people die without notice, not all people have a chance to fullfil everything. Its was great for Wanda's motivation moving forward. And Clint naming his son, Natalian Pietro Barton was nice. If you have seen Endgame, Clint's Son name is cursed. Captain America and Iron Man's fude continues, 'Everytime someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die'. The bitterness was better in Avengers 1 but still Avengers 2 has some great lines, 'A suit of armour everywhere' , 'We would lose -- Then we would do that together too' and seeing this lines pop up again in Endgame was fantastic. Thor has a side journey which I am not a fan, the slow discovery of infinity stones is great in the long run but it doesn't add anything to this movie in particular. Comparatively Wakanda's setup was better, as Ultron was also in the mix. Black Widow and Banner has romantic interaction which I liked at first but now it feels forced as they didn't continue with it. Ultron is just is another one of MCU's bad motivated villains, if they fleshed out the movitations more instead of weak subplots of Thor and Widow then it would have been better. James Spader voice is great, sometimes too comici. And sometimes thinking about how Ultron spends 5 minutes in the internet to decide to kill off humanity completely gets me cracking, it was good motivation but not fleshed out enough. Nick Fury adds more humor to the mix and Burton's family makes this movies more humanly relatable-- They are litteral Gods, and I have a bow & arrow. The ending is epic as a Avengers 3rd act should be, but Joss Wedons Avengers 1 was more well crafted. Hulkbuster Sequence was great sequence of entertainment. Movie could have much better, Loki was set up early, Thanos for 6 years but Ultron's set up & pay off was in the same film.",27-Jun-20,3.5,0.116,0.639,0.246,0.9974,,,,,,

Chris F,"Avengers: Age of Ultron, directed by Joss Whedon, was surprisingly underwhelming. With all the hype around this film, Joss Whedon did his best to give us a great sequel to Marvel's: Avengers, with some solid character moments and ideas, but this essentially felt like a rushed out, second part of the first installment, while also creating so much exposition for what's to come. It sucks that this film has such a huge play in the overall concept of the saga because, it's massively overstuffed with messy subplots, and underdeveloped characters. The pacing of the film was very choppy, due to the extended amount of content that was cut in the editing room. The way each scene tied into eachother, felt real lose, and you can sense that they cut out some key moments that could've pieced together their scenes better. With this being more of a story-driven narrative, I needed more than just another premise we've seen before. Whedon and the creative team incorporated too much filler, and because of that, you start to feel the run time as the film progresses. Whedon tried to weave in the same tones as the first film, but due to everything being botched together, the tones didn't flow nearly as good as the first installment. The way Whedon and the team structured this film, they set themselves up to be nit picked all day long, with one of the biggest comic book type films the MCU has put out. They tried to involve more stakes, but there wasn't too much of a wow factor. You come to these films to grow with these characters, and to enjoy their chemisty, mixed with their banter, and you get that here, but there wasn't too much focus or development with any of out main avengers, besides Hawkeye. Whedon and the team dropped the ball this time with balancing the characters. In the first installment, everyone had a purpose, and fulfilled it to almost every level; here, they are all doing their own things, setting up for what's to come in the next phase of the MCU, instead of keeping this narrative as tight as possible, while subtly setting things up. Robert Downey Jr. still puts on a fantastic performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, continuing to get good layers, but his character arch is a mixed bag. He's such a great character for his wits, and leadership skills, but he starts to become more and more arrogant, and independent. Chris Evans continues his admirable performance as Steve Rogers/Captain America, while starting to get comfortable with taking charge, brewing up great development between Tony and himself. Chris Hemsworth is all over the place in this film. Strangely, he felt shadowed at times when everyone was together, other than his developing bond with Captain America, but when he had his character moments, it was strictly exposition. Mark Ruffalo returns as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and his character arch ran the same lines as Thor. They start to develop Banner's relationship with Romanoff, and I'm 50/50 with the concept. It's a good grounding for Hulk, but then it just gives Scarlett Johansson another reason to be a flirt. One of the best things about this film, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. We finally get more background on him, after three films, and I welcomed that with open arms; He's just a likable character! He has this great humanized aspect, that helps create a nice bond with the audience. Another intelligent, and entertaining addition to the film was Paul Bettany as Vision! For starters, his practical look was amazing! Bettany brings this tremendous wit to the character, while easily being one of the strongest! My only issue with the character, I just wish we got a little more on him, and from him. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as QuickSilver was fine, with some decent potential, but he was almost illegally underdeveloped. I enjoyed the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda more, being more entertaining, and a lot more powerful, but just like QuickSilver, she was underdeveloped as well. I tried really hard to like James Spader as Ultron, but I just couldn't do it. I appreciate that Whedon and the team tried to make him outside of the box, with a clever back story approach, but with his character being poorly written, with an unoriginal motive, he was just wasted potential as a villain. You can tell Spader had his fun with the character, but he didn't bring a whole lot of tention to any scenes that he was in, being pretty dimwitted, and underdeveloped. The screenplay had it's moments of success, but because of the premise being overcrowded, nothing was able to flow together all that well. Joss Whedon upped the dosage of cheesy jokes, and just like the writting, the jokes were hit and miss. The action is one of the standouts of the film. With it being handled by Joss Whedon, you know it's going to be well shot, high octane, and big fun! I would go as far as saying that, some of the action in this film, was handled better than the first installment. Overall, I don't hate Age of Ultron, it's actually one of those films I don't mind revisiting, but because it doesn't age the best, with expositions here, there, and everywhere, I can't put Age of Ultron at the top of my MCU list.",18-Jun-20,3.5,0.038,0.766,0.196,0.9995,,,,,,

Bryson Z,"After all these years and all these MCU movies, things are finally starting to pay off. Thanos is a character that audiences can't help but be interested in. Unfortunately, the movie feels very disjointed. Because there's so many characters, it can be awhile before we check in on a character we had earlier in the movie. That's not necessarily an issue in itself, but sometimes their actions are forgettable, so you have to remind yourself what they're even doing. There's a big focus on the Guardians of the Galaxy which I like, but they definitely get a lot of screen time compared to other Avenger veterans. Tom Holland and RDJ have great chemistry. Their characters work very well together. CGI can he kind of hit or miss depending on the scene. All-in-all, this is a very good movie that is leading to a heart-stopping conclusion, and I would definitely recommend this movie to others.",12-Mar-22,3.5,0.064,0.763,0.173,0.9718,,,,,,

Kyle E,"Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen. Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it. However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view. Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox",24-Feb-22,5,0.096,0.712,0.192,0.9972,,,,,,

Dustin D,"Disney's Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is about an infinite number of superheros fighting the halfway-existential threat of Thanos. The movie is even more bloated than the previous two Avengers films, but surprisingly holds together. Thanos is the most compelling villain yet. He does not see himself as the villain. He has a rational motivation for wiping out half the universe, and has the courage of his convictions. He shows humanity, despite being a giant, purple space monster. The ending, however, did not resonate as much as it should have. With half the MCU heroes being wiped out (though none of the ones who signed a four-film contract and leaving only about 70 Avengers for the next film), the audience should have been devastated. But since these films are so tonally light and cartoonish, the stakes don't feel all that high.",8-Feb-22,5,0.136,0.752,0.112,-0.7136,,,,,,

Gabriel A,"Avengers: Infinity War tells the story of the combat of several heroes against an enemy, much bigger than them. The movie is, quite simply, a 21st century masterpiece, probably the best hero movie after its sequel. The biggest highlight is its script, which managed to bring together several characters and built a VERY intriguing story, and its visual and general direction, which is impeccable. Not only that, but the adventure and action are perfect, especially with the good acting. Another extremely positive point is that, even though the film is long, there is not a moment when you disconnect, as the jokes are balanced, the dialogues are not tiring and the story is captivating. The film is an explosion of emotions, especially for fans. Honestly, I dont see any major downsides in the film. Everything fits perfectly.

K C,"This film was so highly anticipated that it seems like the creators felt like failure was impossible, and so over hyped after-the-fact that nobody wants to point out the obvious flaws. Now, if I decided to delve into every issue I had with the film, we'd be here all day, so I'll focus on my biggest gripes. These two things are crucial to get right if you want to make a quality film, especially a superhero film and ESPECIALLY one this ambitious. You can't sacrifice the basics. The script, and the villain. The script was cringe worthy from the very beginning. You could tell the actors were doing their best with what they were given, but unfortunately their efforts couldn't salvage it. Many lines and scenes felt superfluous and doused in gravitas without any substance to speak of, leaving me wondering if I was missing something. It seems like it would be difficult to make your characters sound like they're being over dramatic when the stakes are half the lives in the universe, but somehow this script succeeds. However, my absolute biggest gripe of the film was the flimsy, unsympathetic, one-dimensional and frustratingly melodramatic villain, Thanos. Now, I know for a fact that Marvel knows how to write a quality villain. You've got sympathetic characters that, under certain circumstances, you may actually find yourself rooting for like Helmut Zemo, Eric Killmonger, Ava Starr and (more recently) Black Widow's adaptation of Taskmaster. There are charismatic, campy villains that sacrifice relatability for entertainment value like Hela, Mysterio and (more recently) Agatha Harkness. There are tragic villains that compellingly surrendered to the lemons life gave them like Loki and (more recently) Wenwu. Even most of Marvel's villains who are just straight-up psychopaths have a fleshed-out motivation, like a lust for power or money (Ulysses Klau), revenge (Aldrich Killian, Ivan Vanko), or zealotry (Ronan, Kaecilius) to support and strengthen their character Thanos has exactly none of those things. Maybe he'd be sympathetic if we knew more about him, but we don't. He's not charismatic, tragic or relatable. As a matter of fact, he has no clear motivation for his actions whatsoever, making the melodrama of his speech pattern unearned, incredibly grating and frankly hard to watch. I have no idea what gets him out of bed in the morning or what happened in his life to get him to this point. Maybe he's more fleshed out in the comic books, but if your movie has required reading in order to enjoy it, I'm sorry, you're doing something wrong. This conundrum is further emphasized by the fact that his end goal doesn't make sense, and there are about a million alternative solutions available to the wielder of the infinity gauntlet to the problem of overpopulation that don't include genociding half of all life, yet he seems stuck on it for absolutely no reason. A good superhero movie is made or broken by the quality of the villain, and the whiny, superficial antagonist here was incredibly immersion-breaking. I didn't believe him. To me, he felt like nothing more than an overpowered, psychopathic, petulant child. Overall, I have to say, I expected a lot more from Marvel. The plot felt rushed and the interactions of the characters that don't typically interact felt clunky, lazily written, and at times felt like entirely different characters than the ones I've come to love. I genuinely don't understand how so many people claim to love this film so much. It was, simply, terrible.",24-Jan-22,4.5,0.141,0.717,0.142,-0.5933,,,,,,

The main character of this film is Thanos, and so we get to understand his psychology and by the end of the film, we understand without a doubt how far he is willing to go to complete his mission. Tony stark has a brilliant story where he once again risks his life to save the world. Watching him at the end as he realizes that they failed and loses Peter in his arms is a gut wrenching and poignant ending. Thor's brilliant character work started by Waititi in Ragnarok is carried on here along with the humour and he has my favourite scenes in the movie: his interactions with the Guardians, his quiet moment of reflection with Groot and Rocket, his entrance into Wakanda and his final confrontation with Thanos, all just brilliant. Captain America has the least to do of the big three, but his story is still good as the one to lead the defence on Earth alongside T'Challa in Wakanda, while trying to save Vision.

With a wide range of characters, and multiple plotlines going on, this movie should be one of the hardest to keep track of, yet everything blends and flows almost seamlessly. There are of course hard cuts in the story that happen as it switches to different characters, but second after the cut the new scene already stations itself and get the viewer back on track. The entire movie is a rollercoaster of action, emotion, and witty humor that keeps it going as a movie that will be remembered as one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe films.

A movie that shoves jokes in any crevice it can find and won't even take itself seriously because the writers know how laughably childish and braindead this film series is. I sat there in the theatre, my brain melting from the starburst cacophony of CGI battle effects that seemingly went on without any direction. It gets boring watching the same city destroyed, the same tired cliches, and a pot designed for people with the attention span of a goldfish. Yet in the end it was all for nothing. There was no solid conclusion to this idiotic yet convoluted plot, just a set up for the next cash-in sequel.

It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",18-Nov-21,5,0.087,0.702,0.211,0.9801,,,,,,

Cailan D,"Avengers: Infinity War is the fourth big group movie of the MCU, but it takes the big group concept to a whole new level with it's massive cast of characters. Basically every big actor in the MCU (with the exception of a few) is in this movie, making it a true culmination movie and appropriately so as its release year of 2018 marks 10 years of the MCU. Considering how many actors are in this movie, it manages to not squander any of them and give many of them moments to shine and funny lines. The movie has some of the most hilarious one-liners of the whole MCU, and is sure to give viewers a lot of laughs along the way. The film also raises the stakes to the highest they've been in any Marvel movie ever, which grips people with anxiety and doubt the whole way through and never lets them go. The action hits and rises above the standard set by its two predecessors by giving us fight sequences with a much bigger scale than anything seen in the previous two Avengers movies. Thanos is a much better villain than Ultron was because while his execution of his goals isn't great, his goals themselves aren't necessarily bad, giving us a villain who is multidimensional and complex and actually dealing with real world problems. This calls into question the meaning behind the Avengers conflict with him and whether or not there were other methods by which the conflict could've been resolved or Thanos could've achieved his goals. But even more, Thanos is an incredibly powerful being and one who could actually achieve his goals despite having to face the Avengers, which differentiates him from other compelling MCU villains. He is a threat that the Avengers haven't had to deal with so far and are not fully prepared for. Thanos manages to achieve his goals at the end, making him only the second in the MCU to do so and remain alive, Zemo being the previous one. This makes Infinity War's end truly emotional for fans of the characters and the characters themselves and creates a huge cliffhanger for its sequel. While there are certainly things Infinity War could done a better job of addressing, the movie redeems the Avengers franchise from Age of Ultron and should leave viewers satisfied yet wanting more as the credits roll.",23-Jul-21,4.5,0.115,0.737,0.148,0.9335,,,,,,

This movie does take a step back in the characterization of T'Challa however, where I feel his character in Civil War is slightly more serious and badass than in this movie.",1-May-22,5,0.143,0.642,0.215,0.8396,,,,,,

Heather B,"Despite the name being the title character, it's the women that make this movie what it is. Shuri is one of my favorite MCU characters, it still breaks my heart we don't really get to see her and Tony together. Can you imagine? The screen would explode trying to contain all that intelligence and sass. But besides Shuri we have the incredible Okoye and the Dora Milaje, Angela Bassett as Queen Ramona, and the incomparable Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia. People talk about the bland and basic Wonder Woman as a woman power movie, ah NO. This right here is where it's at. I love all their strength, and I love that as one lucky woman who got to meet Chadwick on Jimmy Fallon said, 'they're not strong because they're angry(a typical catch-all used to show black female strength), they're strong because they are STRONG.' It's not the crown of the MCU, but I think it's damn close. I've watched it more times than any other MCU except maybe Iron Man. The plot is perfectly on point as T'Challa has to work through the sins of his beloved father and figure out his and Wakanda's role in putting things right. Chadwick was perfect, but my favorite of the male characters was definitely Winston Duke as M'Baku. Andy Sarkis is also delicious fun as Ulysses, and Martin Freeman (always a favorite for me) is excellent as a pompous CIA agent who gets educated in the best of ways. There are so many excellent scenes in here, but my favorite is probably Killmonger's speech in the stand-in British Museum. His speech cuts like a scalpel.

Just Saying ',"I find it ironic that for an ethnic race that is always in the limelight screaming for equality, for diversity, for attention...that the movie has no diversity at all when the movie is directed by a black person and written by two black people. If you google, 'black panther movie cast' and click on the cast icon, It shows 48 cast members of which 38 are black people, 8 white people, and 2 Asians. Don't you love the diversity in this movie? Movies and tv series have been changing characters from white to black lately. To give examples: Superman(Michael B Jordan's Superman), Mary Jane Watson(Spiderman), Kingpin(Daredevil), Catwoman(The Batman/Catwoman), Jimmy Olsen(Supergirl), Johnny Storm(Fantastic Four), Perry White(Man of Steel), Harvey Dent(Batman), Deadshot(Suicide Squad), Heimdall(Thor), Nick Fury(Marvel Studio Films), Martian Manhunter(Smallville/Supergirl), Alicia Masters(Fantastic Four), Pete Ross(Smallville), Iris West(The Flash), Electro(Amazing Spiderman 2), Baron Mordo(Doctor Strange), Callisto(X-Men Last Stand), Manchester Black(Supergirl), Starfire(Titans), Hawkgirl(Legends of Tomorrow) to name a few just in the Super Hero genre. If you are going to diversify and change the vision for the creator's characters, you are essentially changing the essence of the characters themselves. To give you examples: Black Panther, Luke Cage, Storm, Amanda Waller, Aqualad, Black Lightning, Bishop, Green Lantern John Stewart, Shadow Hawk, Spawn, Ironheart, Sunspot, War Machine, Lady Hawk, Misty Knight, Falcon, Shadowman, and Blade...let's diversify and make them WHITE. You are probably thinking no way those are black characters, right?

Filled exciting family drama, a story of how to define what is good and how should that be achieved is an amazing message that was conveyed. The cinematography was good, great funny moments. Chadwick Boseman is a phenomenal actor. Sad to see such an amazing person pass away and hopefully he is resting in peace.

Mojo W,"Black Panther sucks (I'm sorry, but it does). This movie, is a mess, from dumb plot conveniences to inconsistent characters, Black Panther is not a movie that I like to go back and rewatch. The actors are putting on brilliant performances, especially Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger and the late Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, the sound effects are amazing and the CGI is good until the final battle, until it devolves into a bad PS2 boss fight. Other than that, this movie doesn't have much going for it. Having a similar plot to the Lion King, you'd think this movie would be good, but nope. Everything the Lion King succeeds at, Black Panther fails at miserably. For example, in the Lion King, Mufasa dies about half way through the movie then Scar takes the throne, giving the writers time to establish Scar as the villain and giving us time to understand how Scar will rule the Pride Lands before Simba comes back in the end and defeats him. However, in Black Panther, T'Challa and Killmonger only meet about 90 minutes into the movie, then T'Challa fake dies and comes back to life in the span of 15 minutes and then Killmonger dies 10 minutes later, giving us no time to understand Killmonger's motivation and his way of ruling Wakanda. I could go on forever about all of Black Panther's problems, but I have a life, so I'll leave it with this: Black Panther was not a good movie and I'm not excited for the sequel.",15-Feb-22,0.5,0.175,0.692,0.133,-0.8894,,,,,,

I think one of the reasons he was so great is because he got enough screen time, writers really made him an important part of the movie and not just an empty accesory to justify a final battle. The movie portraits different aspects of african culture, which makes it really enjoyable. The writing was brilliant, with no filling material and really interesting side-stories. And lastly, the sounds effects/music/soundtrack was just brilliant! It came as no surprise to me the fact that this movie won Best Original Score during the Academy Awards 2019.

Bradley W,"Black Panther is a good Marvel movie, and in terms of what it accomplished with creating an African superhero it is a major accomplishment that it was done properly. While it is not a perfect movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it does fix many of the problems most comic book movies have, but having an interesting villain with a good backstory and some development the film is already a step ahead of other marvel films. The biggest downers of the movie are the final battle scene does not bring the spectacle one would expect from Wakanda, and the plot can get a little slow at points. Overall though the film is fun to watch. I recommend going back and watching it again, but if doing a bare minimum watch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this one overall can be skipped.",16-Dec-21,4,0.079,0.788,0.133,0.8152,,,,,,

Slade T,I have two questions then a statement and I'll begin my review. First question is should this movie been better suited to be called Wakanda? Second question is the movie lacks consistency which explains why fans didn't enjoy it as much. Some movies have worlds of potential and fall short because they stab themselves in the heart and that is exactly what this one did. And lastly R.I.P Chadwick B. So let's dig in and breakdown exactly as to why I think this to be so. BTW SPOILERS The villain has a crazy ideal and creates plot holes. Killmonger who is a regular villain of T'challa is killed. He is angry because he grew up in Oakland instead of Royalty and his dad was killed by his Uncle. Not only is he murdered by his own cousin but he wants to blow up the world and that will solve his problems? As if it's not enough to get your head around let's go back to Canon of just the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe). Thor doesn't kill his brother Loki. Thor also doesn't kill his sister Hela in Ragnarok either. Go ahead and name an MCU movie where the titular character kills their own family. I'll wait... So no Marvel movie except Black Panther a hero kills his own family. This is striking because T'challa is a noble and smart character and he cannot defeat his own cousin without killing him under the sunset? Let's just tip toe past all that and focus on how the movie is called Black Panther and he is barely in the movie. Its about a hidden kingdom that soon will be not so hidden with Black Panthers ex girl played by Lupita and his sister Shruti and the Queen and Shaman the list goes on. There are so many characters which make it an ensemble cast yet that takes away from Black Panther. He is very similar to Captain America in that he is boring. He doesn't have a sense of humor like the latter Thor in Ragnarok looking forward to Natalie's return in Love and Thunder. He isn't quirky like Spiderman or exuberantly confident like Ironman. Iron man 3 sucked btw and I'm not sure if I'll even review it. Sorry we are staying on track here and I haven't done a review in a while. T'challa is not an exciting character. He doesn't say much and let's his actions do all the talking. He spent the entire time grieving for his dad even though he kicked ass in Winter soldier. His kick assert in this movie was lacking greatly so much so that he lost the tribal battle against Killmonger. To me or anyone we understand the stakes are high for our heroes yet there is a point of no return. T'challa cannot challenge Killmonger again until they do the traditional waterfall fight. Killmonger actually became the rightful king. I could go on about how they killed Andy Serkis way too early or how the other Hobbit guy stole the end of the show but instead I'll ponder upon this. I watched this movie opening night at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. I left quiet and dissapointed because my hero was chop liver. He wasn't the focus in his own movie. He was supported by all the women around them and hey that's cool but the movie is.not called Wakand or Black Panther and friends. Give him his own movie and unfortunately we will never be able to continue with this great character played by Chadwick Boseman. The writing is what I have to blame. Not the actors. Then again I think Michael B. Jordan over-acted but hey it's a different type of character right? One more thing and I'll forever hold my piece until the next review about this movie comes to light. Black Panther jumps on a grenade to save everyone and the bad guys get away from the museum. Then the same type of grenade stops him and the bad guys in fact do get away. Which happens again when he's on top of the car and decides to surf on the car door.... damn this movie sucked but I gave it two and a half stars. If you don't like it well write your own review.

This is the worst ""hero"" origins story thus far and it is a film that desperately needed a story worth telling and a script worth using. There is so much about this movie that takes away from what could have been a great movie, but nothing was more disrespectful to the audience than building a community center in a US city as the major act to rectify keeping everything to themselves in Wakanda. Black Panther does this while ignoring the starving, suffering, dying Africans in countries surrounding Wakanda, as if to say the African American youth in America are more in need of help from Wakanda than the poorest and most destitute people in the world who live on the same continent. Apart from being a empty boring movie, it's also claims to speak from an African perspective yet the reality is that it is an American perspective of Africa.

This is also the perfect setup for Infinity War, while also being its own thing. However, where this film lacks is the CGI field, which looks horrendous at parts, especially in the third act. I also thought the film had some weak action sequences, more specifically the first and last fight scenes, where it was extremely dark to the point I couldn't see a thing.

Cheap special effects that make the fights look like a video game level and a superficial plot not unlike many other superhero movies we've seen before.

Dave D,"Black Panther is no doubt a worldwide phenomenon. This film needed to be made especially considering the time period it was made in. From the costuming to the commentary the story says about the world around us, Black Panther is truly a masterpiece. The costuming in this film is outstanding and used to simulate real world African culture. Most people would think that the costuming ends at the clothing choices. However, I would argue that it continues over into the dialogue accent too. For instance, you can put African garment on any black person and tell them to act African, but the only thing that would really bring the whole thing together is the accent. The director knew this and used it in many ways to give the film complexity. We all know Chadwick Bozeman (the actor to plays black panther) has a American accent in real life but the movie creators never let Chadwick, or any of the other actors that play Wakandans, break that accent once in the movie. This was to brings the realism that Wakanda is an African culture even though we know it doesn't truly exist. The only actor to break this rule is Denzel Whitaker (young Zuri). This was intentional to fool the audience just like how N'jobu was fooled. The character Kilmonger also has a American accent all throughout the film even though we see he knows how to turn on the accent. This was definitely used to show the audience which side of his heritage he truly sides with. The use of accents in the film shows how in real life all that is differentiating black and African people is how we speak. We are the exact same. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has a child and people who are just black in general. The young ones will learn more about the world we live in through a source they actually find entertaining. And all the colored people will just enjoy the culture of this film.",22-Oct-21,4.5,0.034,0.853,0.113,0.9832,,,,,,

The hero ""dies"" in the first third of their first title movie owned by Disney and then stays missing for a third of the movie, as if anyone in the audience believed for even a second that was the case, we don't even get a body so you know he is coming back and it takes forever to do so. We then get to spend a large portion of the movie with three background characters, his sister, his mother, and his ex-girlfriend that we all know painfully well he will end up with by the end of the movie- during this extended time with them their characters aren't developed at all. They are just as 2 dimensional by the time Black Panther returns as when he left, we learned nothing significant about them and they had zero character growth, and the little sister is sooo annoying. The war rhinos, fabric laser shields, and super spears are all really dumb. This is a super science community that is hyper-advanced but they pick their leader with a death brawl. Not even a war game to demonstrate abilities as a commander on the battlefield, literally just a fistfight. When Black Panther does return he doesn't even fight many people, has a weird all CGI dream sequence with a character that died in a previous movie, and then finishes things in true marvel fashion, an all CGI but bloodless fight with a villain who has similar powers, for less time, but at the start of the fight is better at using them to create false tension. Oh and despite this being an origin story for the Black Panther he has both his powers, suit, and title before the movie even starts.",22-Sep-21,1.5,0.159,0.724,0.118,-0.9676,,,,,,

Nathan D,"Black Panther is a great film with a lot of emotion and heart. The story is the main focus of the film, and it shines throughout the whole movie. As much as I liked the story, I do think that it was a bit off. The writing was good, and there were a lot of solid aspects of the film. Yet, I still felt like the film needed more. There were a lot of aspects of the film that felt unexplained. For example, the tribe system in Wakanda seemed a bit confusing. Some additional exposition that showed how the tribe system works in Wakanda would have made the movie a lot stronger. There was also a lack of balance in the different parts of the film. The three main aspects of this film, the action, the story, and the message, were not equally balanced in the overall product. I felt that while the message of the film was great, it took over the other two aspects at times. This problem created some pacing issues as some sequences dragged on for way too long, leaving some parts of the film to lose momentum. The film desperately needed another big action scene and more explanation in the story department. What was already in the film was solid, but the movie just needed to be elevated to a higher place. The technical aspects of the film were also a mixed bag. The cinematography was visually pleasing, and I thought a lot of the movie looked very beautifully shot. What didn't look great was the VFX and CGI. There were some solid visual effects at some points, but then some looked awful. The CG characters looked very wonky at times. The T'Challa and Killmonger battle sequence was just a CG mess. The score, on the other hand, was very nicely done. It felt cohesive throughout the whole film and made it sound unique and special for this film. The production and set design were also quite nice as Wakanda looked stunning. The editing was also pretty solid, but it felt a bit jarring at times. The cast was the highlight of the film as there were so many actors who did such a great job. Chadwick Boseman did an outstanding job as T'Challa and made him such a strong, emotional character. There was never a dull moment from Boseman. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira also did very well in their respective roles as they brought some dynamics to the film that were needed in the overall story. Someone I did not care for was Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. Something about Jordan's performance felt so off. It is like Jordan didn't even try to make his character have multiple emotions. The rest of the supporting cast was great, and it seemed like they were having tons of fun making this film. Overall, Black Panther is a film that just needed some upgrades in some departments. There were very few scenes where I was wowed with what was on screen. The film needed to get some better VFX and CGI in addition to some slight script upgrades that would have translated to a better-paced film. However, with a great score and a solid cast, Black Panther does make for an entertaining film. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",22-Aug-21,1,0.037,0.748,0.215,0.9989,,,,,,

Neil V,"The things that I loved about Black Panther, I really loved and the things that I disliked, I loathed. I thought the cast, storyline, acting and overall message was great for the most part. I can't help but feel that the movie was slightly overrated though. That said, if you look at the impact this movie had around the world (particularly in the BIPOC community), it's tough to call it ""overrated"". What I liked most was Boseman's (RIP :() performance and how he brought T'Challa to life in a way I don't think anyone else could've. Even more so when we learned of what Chadwick had gone through while casting which makes me appreciate him/BP even more so. The only reason I didn't give this a 4/4.5 star rating is because I found it boring at times, a little forceful with it's narrative and some of the CGI was not to the typical standard you'd expect to see in a Marvel movie. I 100% recommend watching, but it may not blow you away like other MCU flicks do.",18-Aug-21,1.5,0.057,0.827,0.116,0.9159,,,,,,

It has great action sequences with an incredible cast, compelling story and brilliant humour but its repetitive sequences, and basic uses of the plot become so prominent that it diverts your engagement in a dissatisfying way.

Cailan D,"Black Panther is a true masterpiece and has a finesse to it that we haven't seen in any Marvel movie period since Spider-Man 2. The film pushes the race barrier of superhero films to much success, considering that in the whole movie there are only two substantive white actors. It's filled with visual splendor and takes us on a fantastic journey into the technologically advanced nation of Wakanda, which was teased in the mid-credits scene of Civil War. The cultural approach of the movie is unique and not something other MCU installments have really done. Rather than simply take us on a tour through Wakanda, the filmmakers walk us through its history and how it came to be what it is at the time of the movie, which gives us an amazing lens through which to view this nation that we're being introduced to. The action, which is superb, also has strong cultural roots, giving us fights that are intended to happen and unavoidable in a way that they're not in other movies. Black Panther has some hilarious dialogue that is supplemented by the phenomenal cast performances, and makes some references of its own that teenage viewers are sure to understand. Killmonger is one of the best villains that we've seen in the MCU because he's given a great backstory, some truly emotional moments, and actually convinces the hero to change his mind and take actions based on that that will forever alter Wakanda as a nation and civilization. T'Challa even tries to help Killmonger at the end of the film, creating an amazing hero-villain dynamic that we don't see everyday. Despite having no powers of his own, Killmonger is a very intimidating and convincing villain and sets a possibly unbeatable bar for future villains and big-baddies. Through all of this, Black Panther is a superhero film and icon that can be looked at through multiple different perspectives: blockbuster entertainment, culture, academics, technology, etc. Black Panther has some of the best of what Marvel has to offer and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is a Marvel fan in general.",23-Jul-21,4,0.062,0.721,0.217,0.996,,,,,,

Kyle E,"The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better. 'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults. Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it. As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong? However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings. The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism. There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas. Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox",13-Mar-22,4.5,0.136,0.699,0.165,0.9908,,,,,,

Matthew D,"A fierce battle between friends over ideologies. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo's superhero espionage action-thriller Captain America: Civil War (2016). Their striking intensity for the intriguing espionage of sleeper cell agents like The Winter Soldier is fascinating in the midst of chaos within The Avengers' greatest argument. The action is creative and thrilling as our beloved heroes use their powers in new and inventive ways against one another. I was laughing and concerned for these characters despite knowing no one would die from this artificial conflict. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were right to give The Russo Brothers the directing gig for Civil War as it nicely follows up on The Winter Soldier plot. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make you care about each hero and their opinion. I love how you do believe Captain America and Iron Man each have real motivations to fight for what they believe in as The Avengers face UN oversight versus freedom of choice. I definitely sympathize more with Captain America's thinking as why would The Avengers ever trust the United States government, let alone a nebulous political body like the UN to guide their superpowered actions? Captain America chooses to do what is morally right, while Iron Man wants to be responsible for all of the destruction The Avengers cause, let alone the death toll. I enjoyed Zemo's complex scheme as why fight The Avengers, when I can get them to kill each other, is a better plan than most Marvel villains. Chris Evans is steadfast as the moral man with stars and stripes Steve Rogers. Evans' Captain America hits hard with killer action choreography, but it's Evans' performance as the kind and thoughtful Captain America that will not give up on The Winter Soldier still having Bucky's personality and mind in there somewhere. I like how Evans' shows he is not guilty, but proud to value freedom of choice as an American value in regards to not allowing The Avengers to assemble as government stooges. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent at expressing his heartbroken emotions over his parents untimely demise as well as his conflicted feelings over The Avengers operating unrestricted. Scarlett Johansson is amazing as the ruthless fighter spy Black Widow and really earnest as Natasha Romanoff. Her ability to convince you that Black Widow would side with Iron Man, then realize that Captain America is only doing what is right speaks volumes about her character. Sebastian Stan is cool, exciting, and devastating as you watch Bucky get tortured until he's a sleeper cell agent called The Winter Soldier. Anthony Mackie is very casually funny as Falcon as is Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. Ant-Man's enlarged form steals the show and Rudd is so charming as this oddball hero. Don Cheadle is touching as the veteran War Machine and cool during the crazy airport battle. Jeremy Renner is fantastic as Hawkeye with a weary and funny performance as the artful archer. Chadwick Boseman is immediately cool and mysterious as Black Panther. His combat is mesmerizing, let alone his commanding gravitas. Paul Bettany makes Vision feel wise, even when he's wrong. You believe that Vision wants to protect Wanda, but he does not trust her with her own powers. Elizabeth Olsen is moving as the hurt Wanda Maximoff, while awesome as the magical Scarlet Witch. Emily VanCamp is endearing as Agent 13 or Sharon Carter. Tom Holland is likable and funny as the young Peter Parker and Spider-Man. His quips and nervous manner feel like comic book Spider-Man. Daniel Brühl's antagonist Zemo is understandable in his vengeful rage and sinister in conversation with The Avengers. Frank Grillo's Crossbones is intense in the action opener, while William Hurt packs a dramatic punch as the voice of the UN not authorizing The Avengers to operate of their own accord. Martin Freeman is funny as a government stooge. Marisa Tomei is gorgeous and playful as Aunt May. John Kani, John Slattery, Alfre Woodward, Jim Rash, and Stan Lee all have nice cameos. Editor Jeffrey Ford cuts swiftly between character point of views and gives each person time to speak naturally in gently cut conversations. The action is fast and sharp as opposed to the steady and engaging dialogue. Jeffrey Ford Civil War does not feel like 147 minutes long as it just grips you with exciting action immediately, then follows through with its promise of Marvel's mightiest heroes doing battle. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch comes up with innovative ways to shoot the action with wide shots and real stunt performers. Going from Black Widow taking out guys in style to Ant Man's shifting sizes is really neat with creative cinematography. Civil War has a lot of attention to detail with sharp panning shots and nice framing for a change with some Marvel movies. The CGI is amazing for Vision's lasers, Scarlet Witch's red aura magic, and Ant-Man's size changes. Composer Henry Jackman's somber score cuts deep with Civil War's torn characters. His exciting and playful side comes out during the action with sweeping music and melodies bringing in this massive hero brawl. Costume designer Judianna Makovsky came up with cool contemporary Spider-Man and Black Panther outfits that look modern. Overall, Civil War is one of Marvel's most entertaining and interesting movies.",1-Feb-22,5,0.134,0.638,0.228,0.9987,,,,,,

Am I really supposed to feel worried for anyone when this conflict is supposedly meant to shatter the team dynamic? Also I do not like Zemo, his plan is to get rid of the people responsible for protecting the Earth from existential threats that have showed up at least twice already? I guess I understand his motivations but again, it feels forced. The character work for Steve and Tony is great in this, I never doubted that they would make the decisions that they make. But a lot of the supporting cast do not have compelling reasons to be in this fight. Tom Holland and Paul Rudd and T'Challa steal every scene they are in, great additions to the cast.",24-Dec-21,4.5,0.14,0.655,0.205,0.9365,,,,,,
Ben S,A great film with real stakes and a very bleak ending that is very much perfect for this movie. Brilliant performances from Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr make this movie a tense action extravaganza that also sets up stories for new characters as well as expands the arcs for the already established characters we know and love.,22-Dec-21,4.5,0.034,0.686,0.28,0.953,,,,,,
Avi K,"While watching it, it seemed cool. It was thrilling. In retrospect, everything about CW felt forced...the plot, the characters motivations, the outcomes. It all felt like Marvel was ""aggressively"" snapping things into place rather than letting an organic story happen. This may sort of get away from the point a bit, but I dislike the airport scene because of how it ties into the much larger issues the movie has. The airport scene is exciting the first time around but it feels hollow, purposeless, and like I said before, completely contrived (which is how I felt about most of the movie). I personally thought Civil War failed because the conflict between Steve and Tony never once felt right and I couldn't buy into it since neither of them really seemed to be acting like themselves for much of the movie. I thought it actively ruined Tony and Steve with staggering amounts of stubbornness and idiocy. It turned Cap into a petty, backstabbing manipulator who was willing to risk the lives of so many he cares for (people who he knew would never turn him down if he asked for help) rather than actually attempt to have a real discussion with Tony. Tony's sudden 180 into being pro-Government control is so sudden and out of established character that I just never bought it. Yes he's usually a touch of a hypocrite but his distrust of Governments and bureaucracy has been one of the most persistent and clearly defined elements of his character. It really felt like there was a movie missing somewhere which brought them both to this point, and the instances during the movie which rapidly led them to this point felt seriously artificial. The movie is written in a way to make these characters fight, when these characters would have tried to find another solution or at least make a serious attempt at talking things out. The story was seriously forced for much of the movie and I really was disappointed in it. Hell there was no actual character reason at all that Natasha was pro-accords. It was only done so that they could have her fight Hawkeye and so she could suddenly switch sides. The fact that these people would ever endanger the lives of people they care for to the extent they do and come to blows in the way they did was honestly kind of a disgusting bastardization of the characters. The only part I thought actually worked in the movie was Cap and Tony at the end, when Tony learns what Steve had been hiding from him about Bucky and the fight they had. That was the only thing in the movie that actually felt real and I absolutely loved that. It was much very impactful, personal and significant because there was emotion and stakes behind that fight.",22-Dec-21,4.5,0.157,0.753,0.091,-0.9891,,,,,,

With so many plots going on in this movie it does tend to feel a bit rushed at times, and with such a huge cast in a movie with a central focus on a single character the dispute feels very one-sided. There is a lot of story to tell in Civil War, and while a lot of it is done right, it still feels like this is two movies packed into one.

,"While fans like to see heroes fight each other so they can brag about their favorite hero being better than someone else's favorite hero, I'm no fan of heroes fighting each other—especially serious fights. There are non-meaningful fights, like Bucky vs Black Panther, or even the airport scene in this film. But the final fight here between Cap & Iron Man is a meaningful fight—and simply sad, especially as Baron Zemo watches from a distance with pleasure. I'd much rather see villains fight against each other (Doctor Doom vs Magneto vs Ultron vs Loki vs Thanos vs Carnage, anyone?). What was cool was introducing Spider-Man and Black Panther, and going deeper into Vision & Wanda's relationship. The plot was generally fine (even if you were semi-familiar with the comics version of the plot) but the circumstances causing the final fight seemed contrived. I'm probably in the minority but this was a mostly downer movie. The only uplifting moment was discovering the other super-soldiers were dead.",17-Nov-21,4,0.192,0.636,0.172,-0.8519,,,,,,
Aidan B,"A nice change of pace in the MCU, ""Captain America: Civil War"" brings along some new touching elements and some mature themes that help elevate it above the standard Marvel movie. The action is done fine, the CGI is good, and the villain was creatively written. However, where this movie lacks is in the motivations where both the heroes and the villain to do what they do, and I think that if they had held off on the idea, it could've been more grand.

I really enjoyed this in Age of Ultron, and to SOME degree here, but the talking here seems artificial to promote the highlight of this film where each side poses before fighting the other side. The disagreement over the Sokovia Accords seemed just dumb, and both Tony and Steve seemed like they were on the flip side of where they should be. Really? Tony is going to not go save someone when a bureaucrat in Belgium tells him not to? I get character growth and guilt and all, but please. And the fight scenes, while visually appealing, were just stupid. Bat each other around no problem until someone gets hurt, then everyone is like 'OMG dramatic moment'????

The action sequences are spectacular and the introduction to new characters added to the development of existent and returning ones are perfect. Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Chadwick Boseman (King T'Challa/Black Panther) are two of the best characters of this universe. And the comical timing is superb, possibly the best of the whole MCU. Credits to Holland and Paul Rudd.

Cailan D,"Captain America: Civil War is my favorite film in the MCU. It delivers on every front possible and has fantastic performances from every substantial cast member, whether lead or supporting. The fights and action set-pieces are some of the best you'll see in a Marvel movie and raise expectations for future films. The dialogue is top notch and the writing and directing overall are superb. This is a culmination movie but is structurally very different from the two Avengers films that came before it; this works well to its advantage since it gives us a big breath of fresh air. This is the first movie in the MCU that really focuses on the consequences of actions, and references previous installments in the process of doing so. Via this, Civil War is one of the most realistic and believeable movies in the franchise, other than the abilities of some of the characters. Civil War forces the Avengers to ask important questions about themselves as a team and their role in the world and in doing so puts them in difficult positions that have massive ramifications for the Avengers as an organization. The Avengers have had fights and disagreements before, but this movie takes that to another level and it's fascinating to watch them as they attempt to work through it. The writing and directing allow for multiple different storylines to converge without taking away from any of them, and they combine really nicely to add depth and emotional impact to the film. Daniel Bruhl's Zemo is one of the more complicated and convincing villains in the universe and his performance as the character is great, making Zemo a worthy yet unique adversary to the Avengers. Civil War highlights key character changes and furthers arcs for many of the Avengers, beautifully setting them and the team up for next outings. Civil War is also a great blend of humor and seriousness and introduces some big new characters smoothly. Overall, the film has a lot of finesse and is one of the most enjoyable and complex ones in the whole MCU, and is a must-see for Marvel fans.",21-Jul-21,4.5,0.107,0.727,0.166,0.9665,,,,,,

Puroo R,"Back when I had watched Batman v Superman and Captain America: Civil War for the first time, my verdict was absolutely clear: Batman v Superman is clearly the superior one of the two. In Batman v Superman I wanted Batman to win and that's what happened, while in Captain America: Civil War I wanted Iron Man to win but he lost. So I had already made up my mind - I was gonna hate every scene, every character and the whole story of this movie. I completely ignored what made this movie so great, just because it showed Captain America win. I had initially given this movie only 3 stars, but now that I gave it a rewatch, I have realised how wrong I was. The thing that made this movie so great is what the stakes were. After the destruction that had happened in Age of Ultron, the Sokovia Accords were introduced. By convention anyone would think that Steve Rogers will support it being the patriot that he is, while Tony Stark will oppose it being the capitalist that he is. And if that had happened the entire movie would have come crumbling down. But instead, the opposite happened. Steve opposed it since he had seen what the Nazis were capable of, while Tony supported it since he was feling guilty of what happened over there. So here instead of their differences being created on the basis of their superficial ideologies, it changed to their personal ethics. The team that they assembled was not based on similar reasons though. Spider-Man, War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, Scarlett Witch, Falcon - all of them took their sides based on their likeablility. Peter and Rhodes, for example, liked Tony so they took their sides while Wanda and Clint liked Steve more so they took his side. As a result the airport battle resulted in Black Widow changing sides. If she had taken sides with personal reasons, she'd have never done this. Black Panther was the only one who had gone against Captain because of his father's death, and he wanted revenge. Zemo was also a great villain. He was very underappreciated until Falcon and the Winter Soldier came up. He really deserved a lot of praise for his master plan. He made the Avengers fight among themselves, tortured officials and finally made Tony try to kill Bucky. Unlike Ultron, who was the previous big villain, Zemo actually seemed like someone who could do something on his own because he had a complete idea of what he was fighting and what all could be put on the stakes if he really wants to create a rift among the heroes. The fight scenes are the only thing I have a problem with. All the fight scenes which have Black Widow or Hawkeye in them always have tons of jump cuts. This was quite visible in the fight from the beginning of the movie. In the end however, the fight of The Winter Soldier alongside Captain America against Iron Man was pretty well choreographed. The makers of this movie didn't make it seem like Iron Man was weak. The situation was created such that Iron Man couldn't win. His suit was uncharged, he was emotional, they were in close range and he only wanted to incapacitate Captain America. If it had been a proper fight Tony wouldn't have wasted a second to turn them both into pulp. And finally what satisfies me the most is the comeuppance. Captain America and everyone who sided with him got arrested. It felt so good seeing Black Widow get what she deserves. This is probably one of the only MCU movies that actually had a consequence, something which only started happening in MCU after this movie took the bold step. The bad things that happened in this movie affected what will happen in the future. Otherwise one only those characters used to die who had been introduced in that very movie, bad guys always lost, the characters who had died came back to life (looking at you, Infinity War; especially Loki and Gamora). Now that I have learnt to appreciate the good movies, I ahve seen that Captain America: Civil War is actually a very powerful movie. This is a term I use for movies which look great and are great, overall a masterpiece. It's one of the most memorable and impactful MCU movies out there. I'm really sorry about trashing this movie previously. Now that I've grown up, I've also grown into liking it.",16-Jun-21,2.5,0.156,0.686,0.158,0.2448,,,,,,

Spencer B,"The two stories of Cap and Bucky and the Sokovia Accorda never quite gel. Iron Man becomes very unlikeable in this (luckily he got it back in some later movies), and since we know that he is wrong when it comes to Bucky for a lot of it it's hard to see both sides. The Sokovia Accords rules are slightly too vague especially when it comes to later movies (maybe I'm stupid but I didn't fully understand that the rule was that they only needed permission to interfere with other countries/ needed to register until looking it up later), and it doesn't really make sense they'd be so willing to work with the government after events in previous movies. I think if they centered the fight solely around what to do about Bucky (and even had him actually be the one to kill Black Panthers dad while hypnotized causing a more interesting dynamic with justifications on both side) it would have been better.

El Nathan M,"There comes a lot of pressure making a movie associated with a comic. And then there's making a movie association with one of the biggest comics of all time. I don't know how the Russo's did it but this movie is really good. And it shouldn't have been. There are three conflicting storylines in the film. Three. Any other directors would've cracked under pressure. But not the Russo's. They were able to make one of the best Marvel films ever. Great action scenes. Great writing.

Jerry S,"This is my favorite Captain America film. Yes I like this one more than Captain America: The Winter Soldier. For three reasons. Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Ant-Man. These three characters really stoled the show. The best part about them is that they naturally fit in. When I watch this film every time that there on screen I love it. I have a blast every time Spider-Man and Ant-Man talk. I get chills every time Black Panther had an action scene. Now that T'Challa is gone due to Chadwick Boseman's recent passing I rewatch his scenes in sadness. On a brighter note this film has incredible character development. Every single character's disagreement is valid and it fits their character. When they all end up fighting each other at the airport. You know why their fighting and know exactly why they're there. You're not constantly asking why all the time you understand why there doing all of this. This film is also thrilling from beginning to end and you actually really don't know what's going to happen until you watch it until the end. The only problem that I have with this movie his Zemo. His motivation is understandable I just thought that he needed to be more interesting. But they do fix this latter in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. Overall really good film and I can watch this one over and over. 10/10",4-May-21,2.5,0.038,0.861,0.101,0.9237,,,,,,
Taekwondo Life M,"One of the most entertaining and exciting editions of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. The set up of the ideological aspects of Government oversight versus the belief that good people, left to their own devices, will always prevail is well executed in the rivalry between Iron Man and Captain America.

Molly M,"Joe and Anthony Russo's second addition to the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe is an explosive, globe-trotting affair that can't help but feel like the unofficial third Avengers film. When political pressure from numerous sources overflow, the Avengers receive an ultimatum: sign the new 'Sokovia Accords' (documents that mean the Avengers will obey a committee that decides when, where and if they can fight crucial battles) or retire. This deeply divides the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes heroes should remain free to operate without government interference, whereas Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) disagrees and states the Avengers need to be 'put in check'. But when it appears to be Bucky Barnes a.k.a The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is responsible for an attack on the UN building during a meeting for these accords, Steve must jump into action and find Bucky before someone else does. Their disagreement then escalates into an explosive, intense feud that will create a long-lasting rift between the two sides. The film is full of both emotional moments and, in classic Marvel fashion, perilous fight scenes. The Russo Brothers also bring in props and characters from some of their previous jobs - for example, Jim Rash makes a cameo as a member of the MIT team. Due to the vast cast and variety of subplot, viewers could argue that 'Captain America: Civil War' is an unofficial Avengers film. Anthony Mackie even referred to the film as 'Avengers 2.5'. As well as dealing with numerous subplot and storylines, The Russo Brothers were put in charge of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) debut into the MCU. They give each character enough time to be introduced to viewers without their debut taking up chunks of the film. The Russos leave enough unexplained to build up the anticipation for each character's solo films that were to come in the later years: 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' released in 2017 and 'Black Panther' released in 2018. Like any other Marvel film, 'Captain America: Civil War' sets up the future of the MCU. Both 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' are influenced by the events of this 'Civil War'. The casting, as always, is brilliant. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers as the honest, protective man that he is. Robert Downey Jr. brings back Tony Stark's arrogant, humorous personality to viewers, resuming his role as the billionaire playboy. Natasha Romanoff acts as a midpoint between the two sides, joining Tony's team, only to end up letting Cap get away, eventually joining him on the run. Tom Holland brings Peter Parker's nervous, nerdy presence to the screen. His casting also makes him the youngest person to play the iconic web-slinger. Holland was only 19 during filming. Daniel Brühl also makes his Marvel debut as Helmut Zemo, the first non-enhances primary antagonist in the MCU. Brühl brings his slick charm to the character, presenting Zemo as a cold, calculated man on a mission, a mission for revenge. Henry Jackman once again lends his composing ability to the film. Jackman creates a score that features intense climaxes and compliments the action on-screen. Jackman also features and reworks the themes of heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America and the iconic Winter Soldier theme. Trent Olapoch's cinematography is impressive, he captures the feel and aesthetic of the previous Marvel movies while still providing new and unique imagery. If you look at 'Civil War' as a whole, it's clear to see that all the subplot and plotlines come together almost like a jigsaw puzzle. There's a myriad of themes and ideologies floating around the film including grief, accountability and responsibility. The dominant theme that looms over the film is choice. Each character chooses what side they fight on, Steve chose to help Bucky knowing it made him an enemy of the state, and Zemo chose to go after the avengers to relieve his grief. Overall, 'Captain America: Civil War' is an impressive piece of skilful filmmaking that features great performances, detailed storylines and a brilliant score. The Russo Brothers prove that they can wrangle such a large cast and create a complex film that deals with powerful themes and ideas.",14-Apr-21,2.5,0.119,0.752,0.129,0.6688,,,,,,
Lasse L,"This movie successfully balances a lot of plot points.

However, at times it feels like another setup movie with the introduction of Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man, who were soon to get their first movie.

Kian M,This movie stars almost all the avengers. This movie is a story of how our heroes turn on each other because of events from the past.

Lariste K,"Barely watchable due to the obviously exaggerated (ie: retimed) digital camera moves, very herky-jerky fast shutter speed sequences that lack weight or natural movement, convoluted ""plot"" (the movie connects events before the movie to installments after the movie, without much more theme or gravitas than a digital TV show), plus the inherent blandness, and rather obvious flat ground plane for the main CGI-enhanced ""showdown"" at the end of the film. Picture also features: some details about a shadowy Russian operative, plot elements about the antipathy between Captain America and Iron Man, and a few product placements for upcoming installments of Black Panther and Spiderman. This is a film that provides escapism in the worst sense; rather than enchanting viewers, it overloads the senses at various points with frenetic action that's oddly bloodless and forgettable. Franchise entry pic employs legions of non-union CGI contractors, while Downey Jr. walked away with excess of 40 million for his participation in Captain America: Civil War.

Robbie M,"Captain America Civil War is iconic. It will be remembered as the go to example of how to have two protagonists, two good guys fight each other while keeping their characters consistent. It already has larger studios trying to imitate its success and failing to reach the high bar it sets. It perfectly executes the story it wants to tell. However, I feel that everything besides the narrative and characters were unmemorable and unnoteworthy . Creating a realistic scenario where the just, patriotic, noble Steve Rogers and the reformed, changed Tony Stark and not making it feel forced is no small feat. Full credit to the Russo brothers for masterfully crafting this narrative. The key to that narrative being the main antagonist of the film Zemo. Zemo is definitely in the upper tier of Marvel villains. A masterful performance by Daniel Brühl combined with a masterful script and backstory come to make a compelling villain. When it comes to villains in an action movie, brain will always triumph bron. A smart, clever villain will always be leagues more interesting than a villain that is simply buff. Zemo is the perfect example of this, he reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker or Light Yagami, a smart villain with a genius plan.His charisma is nowhere near the level of Light and his look and performance is no where near as iconic as Heath Ledger, but his plan is absolute genius. Aside from the villain, every side character gets fleshed out as well throughout the movie. Black Panther is introduced, and given a stronger character development than in his stand alone movie. Wanda and Vision start to develop a very cute relationship that I'm sure will never, ever be exploited through a dated TV show on a barely relevant streaming service. Spider Holland is introduced, Black Widow continues to be true neutral in the mcu alignment chart, Hawkeye is here, enough said. Taking a step back from character analysis, my overall takeaway is that the movie succeeds in what it sets out to do with flying colors. It sets up a civil war between IronMan and Captain America, explores both their characters further and delivers solid action scenes. So why isn't this movie a 10/10? Honestly, as sad as it is to say it's because it's part of the MCU. The movie doesn't do enough new things to shake up the MCU or it's characters. Looking at it, you may disagree. Spiderman and Black Panther are introduced, Wannda and Vision develop a relationship, Tony Stark and Steve Rodgers fall out and don't speak to each other for years!. It's everything else that feels way too similar, nothing except the characters stand out. The music is unmemorable, the sound design as a whole is bland and flat. Camera work is once again unmemorable, lighting is flat and set design is boring. The best word to describe everything besides the characters and narrative is unnoteworthy. It's not deserving of scorn, but not deserving of praise either. Ultimately, Civil War is a great story, with good production value. No major changes would be needed to improve Captain America Civil War just smaller tweaks would have made a world of difference.",11-Feb-21,5,0.115,0.738,0.147,0.9446,,,,,,

Ryan S,"Awesome! My new favourite, so far at least. What an absolute joy 'Captain America: Civil War' is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less. Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won't spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this. It gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected. Sebastian Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn't love that character in his preceding appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Brühl plays his role very nicely. Elsewhere, Paul Rudd's inclusion is amusing. The whole film, as is normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made. As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I guess there's no hiding who my standout avenger is, eh? The only 'but' I have for this is the title. It's practically an avengers film. I'm not saying it's an ill-fitting title, I get it's the titular character's arc, but I feel like it does the film a slight disservice - it's impacts much more than Captain America. That's not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!",20-Jan-21,1.5,0.041,0.705,0.254,0.9975,,,,,,

Anson Y,"Captain America: Civil War is a true masterpiece! In the light of 2020, it's even better or maybe disappointing. I'm not really sure. This movie has a really good balance between emotional moments and action. All the characters are really good developed and there are a lot good lines. Of course, it's about two sides in the Avengers group. One side who follows the governments of the world and the other side who wants to do what their feelings are saying, but if you look closely it's about a group of friends with different ideas about good and bad. I'm very positive about it and this was my first MCU movie I had ever seen! So this is really iconic for me personally. Why did I say in the light of 2020 it's a bit a point of discussion? Well, Captain America is so good as gone now, but his biggest group of enemies is still not defeated. This is probably his last movie in the Captain America series, so in my opinion it should have happened in this movie. On the other hand it's better with the knowledge of now. Spider-Man and Black Panther have their entrance in the universe. I think the biggest questionable point of this movie is that this movie really can't stand on itself. Almost all the other MCU movies can. It's not really a problem, but it explains why I gave it 4 stars instead of 4,5 or even 5.",2-Dec-20,3.5,0.064,0.757,0.179,0.9848,,,,,,

The whole scenario of Tony eventually realising that bucky was in fact brainwashed for years and had no control of his actions yet still attacked him regardless was pointless resulting in a 2 on 1 handicap fight. What we have here is expectation of a civil war story from the comics resulting into complete collapse of a movie about a playground dispute.....I like him, he is my friend, I like you more than him, I dont like you now, I hate you now you hurt my friend, can we be friends again, I want my toy back as my dad made it.

Kyle E,"Saw 'Doctor Strange' (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn't see people saying a lot here. 'Doctor Strange' is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel's best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn't quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn't buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyoncé). However, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams's character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film's most interesting character and played with relish by her. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing. The story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me). 'Doctor Strange's' script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn't have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material. Where 'Doctor Strange' is particularly good is in the production values. It's very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it's the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage. Overall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it 'Doctor Strange' was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel's best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",13-Mar-22,5,0.048,0.655,0.298,0.9994,,,,,,

However, the effects were great and I really got sucked into the storytelling. And what can I say?

Matthew D,"Doctor Stranges conjures up dazzling magic for Marvel's Cinematic Universe! Director Scott Derrickson' superhero fantasy adventure Doctor Strange (2016) is a personal favorite Marvel movie for me. Since I was a child reading comic books, I have loved Doctor Strange as a superhero who brings magic, mysticism, and intelligence to the comic page. Scott Derrickson brought one of my favorite Avengers to life on the silver screen. Seeing Strange's magic made me nostalgic, but also pleasantly surprised me with the innovative choices in every beguiling sequence of mystic arts. Derrickson's darker, dramatic tone and intriguing mysteries left me wanting a sequel. I loved Doctor Strange! Doctor Strange remains in my top tier of Marvel movies thanks to Derrickson's inventive direction. Scott Derrickson proves himself an intriguing and crafty American auteur with Sinister and Doctor Strange alone. Every scene is unexpected and original with a genuine sense of wonder over the magic Doctor Strange seeks out. From the craziest car crash I've ever seen straight out of the comic to Doctor Strange's creative deal with Dormmamu, Doctor Strange has very surprising magic tricks. Derrickson's direction has real heart for his charming characters and good humor as I was laughing plenty throughout Doctor Strange. I wish Derrickson was allowed to continue his vision for Doctor Strange's sequel, but alas, it was not meant to be I suppose. At least we'll always have Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange. Derrickson did justice for comic book writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko's classic run of Doctor Strange comics. Lee and Ditko gave us creative visuals with Doctor Strange defeating foes with his clever wit and inventive use of his magic powers. You see similar intelligent solutions to problems as Doctor Strange figures out refined methods to dispatch his curious enemies. I appreciate all the care and stellar craftsmanship that director Scott Derrickson brought to the creative table. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust Doctor Strange to Scott Derrickson, who clearly cared about this comic book superhero and interesting character. Writers Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts, and C. Robert Cargill delivers charming jokes, whimsical weird adventure, and magical spellcasting. Their words call upon Stephen Strange to learn humility instead of his arrogance, kindness instead of his selfishness, empathy for the pains of others instead of narcissitically making situations about himself, all with an air of seriousness. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as Dr. Stephen Strange, who becomes the wise and powerful superhero Doctor Strange. Cumberbatch is surprisingly fitting as a brilliant doctor, who is personally greedy, selfish, arrogant, and surly. He transforms into the focused, selfless, funny, gentle, loving, and miraculous Doctor Strange with an air of knowledge and confidence. He takes an unlikable man and turns him into a likable, cool superhero with wizard magic, medical prowess, and tender affections. I love seeing Cumberbatch's motioning around with his hands and arms to cast spells as Doctor Strange. He breathes life into the magic words he says with a serious realism, his booming deep voice, and Cumberbatch's commanding personality. Rachel McAdams is gorgeous with the prettiest face I've ever seen. She's very charming as Strange's love interest and genius medical peer Dr. Christine Palmer. McAdams has actual romantic chemistry with Benedict Cumberbatch's initially emotionally closed off Stephen Strange. I found her scenes with Cumberbatch visceral in her emotional clarity for Palmer's character. She gets Strange to humanize by telling him how awful he's being, but giving him hope for a real loving life with her. If I had any critique of Doctor Strange, it is that I would like even more Rachel McAdams bonding romantically with Benedict Cumberbatch's Strange. Chiwetel Ejiofor feels strong and smart as Baron Karl Mordo with his cautious warnings not to use magic against the natural laws. I'd love to see Ejiofor return as Doctor Strange's infamous archnemesis Baron Mordo. Benedict Wong is hilarious with his casual humor as Strange's supportive friend the librarian monk Wong. Mads Mikkelsen is fearsome and cool as Marvel supervillain Kaecilius. Mikkelsen's heavy gravitas brings a fierce darkness that stupefies you. He feels violent and determined, yet delivers lines with Mads' signature sly persona. I loved Mads Mikkelsen's scenes opposite Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange. Tilda Swinton is very interesting and captivating as The Ancient One. She gives a likable and intense performance that really hammers home the hard lessons Strange must learn. Swinton is so careful with her every strange and subtle choice. Michael Stuhlbarg brings emotional realism to Doctor Strange as Dr. Nicodemus West. He starts out as a foolish and funny character, then gets a touching scene of redemption with Strange. Benjamin Bratt is gripping as the former paralyzed man Jonathan Pangborn. Scott Adkins' hand to hand fighting is impressive as usual as Lucian the Strong Zealot. Stan Lee has another funny cameo this time as a bus passenger. Chris Hemsworth has a quaint cameo as Thor Odinson you have to see! Editors Sabrina Plisco and Wyatt Smith contain Doctor Strange's magic and mysticism down to a brisk 115 minutes long. Their sharp editing cuts between locations as Doctor Strange teleports around is very neat with tight edits splicing worlds in an instant. Between the character development and sharp bursts of Strange's magic, Doctor Strange never feels too long to me. Cinematographer Ben Davis' imaginative ultra wide shots and intimate close-up shots captivate me. Davis' gorgeous and creative cinematography bring Doctor Strange's unique magical realms to life in stunning shots that use every angle, perspective, and framing trick imaginable. From the world folding over itself like in Christopher Nolan's Inception to magical beings pushing characters through space, Doctor Strange has its head in the stars with beautiful imagery that is unlike anything Marvel's movies has reached for before. Only Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy have as ambitious a visual style akin to Scott Derrickson's direction and Ben Davis' cinematography for Doctor Strange. Production designer Charles Wood's sets are very cool from Doctor Strange's warm and mysterious inner sanctum to the lavish CGI worlds Strange is visiting. Art directors Julian Ashby, Mike Stallion, Ray Chan, Michael Manson, Thomas Brown, Jordan Crockett, Mark Swain, Gary Jopling, Jim Barr, and Jason T. Clark captures a surreal psychedelic style for Doctor Strange. From the realistic scenes on Earth to the sudden magical encounters, Doctor Strange's entire aesthetic is right out of a painting. Set decorators John Bush and Stephen Christensen create antique looking furniture and ancient artifacts for Doctor Strange to peruse in his training and home. Visual effects artists Stephane Ceretti, Jonathan Fawkner, Pimentel A. Raphael, Daryl Sawchuk, Nathan McConnel, Loren Robinson, Mathew Cowie, and Alexander Schumann astonish with Marvel's best looking CGI yet. Doctor Strange's magical abilities can be esoteric, so seeing his spells sparkling with breathtaking particle physics. From conjuring magical seals in air, opening portals to other cities, the vastness of Marvel's Multiverse of space, the unfathomable Dark Dimension, time reversing, to the hilarious cloak with its own personality. Doctor Strange is what CGI is capable of in the hands of real artists. Composer Michael Giacchino, of Rogue One, Ratatouille, and Super 8 fame, writes Doctor Strange's score with a marvelous grandeur for the foreboding epic scenes of space and time bending. Giacchino's music is lovely, enthralling, and tender as needed for Doctor Strange's music cues. Giacchino's melodies can be so faint and affecting, then bombastic and mesmerizing. Sound designers Tom Johnson, Shannon Mills, Juan Peralta, Daniel Laurie, David Chrastka, David C. Hughes, Nia Hansen, Josh Gold, and J.R. Grubbs came up with all the neat loud pulsing sounds for Strange's magic powers I enjoyed. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne modernizes the look of Doctor Strange's comic book wizard robes with a brilliant red cape and flowing blue layers. I like the spots of gold too. Doctor Strange definitely has one of Marvel's coolest superhero designs. Everyone on Earth looks remarkably normal, thus Doctor Strange stands out even more besides the other sorcerers. Make-up artists Jeremy Woodhead, Sharon Martin, Nicola Buck, Donald McInnes, Björn Rehbein, Susan Howard, Jessica Brooks, and Malwina Suwinska provide natural nice looks for everyone. I love that they gave Benedict Cumberbatch Strange's goatee and graying side hair. He looks distinguished. Tilda is convincingly made bald as The Ancient One. Mads' eye make-up is really neat. In all, Doctor Strange is a well crafted superhero film from Scott Derrickson. I really adore Benedict Cumberbatch and Rachel McAdams and hope to see them again soon as Doctor Stephen Strange and Dr. Christine Palmer, respectively.",1-Feb-22,3,0.099,0.648,0.253,0.9999,,,,,,

Martin F,"The MCU wants to talk about death and the end of existence... Personally, I think it fails. Marvel movies aim to entertain the public, because of that they don't try to be as serious in Doctor Strange as they should with this kind of heavy themes. Everything feels shallow about it but you still left with a bad aftertaste because having to think about death while watching what you were expecting to be a simple entertainment. It must be one of the most impressive special effects ever been in a movie, the way they play with psychedelic moment, optical illusion, mirror effect is breath taking. The only flaw here with the CGI is the final confrontation that doesn't feel as polished or thoughtful as the rest of the movie. It's a Marvel movie, they know their formula so you will be entertain but neither the main conflict or antagonist feels very important.",6-Dec-21,5,0.13,0.712,0.157,0.7131,,,,,,

Emilio T,"Doctor Strange is an utter blast of a movie, with there never being any dull moments. Scott Derrickson makes this movie what it is with his incredible directing and visual style. Many sequences looked visually stunning. For instance, the scene where Strange goes through other dimensions is astonishing to watch. Derrickson's directing combines quite well with the art direction in this film as many of the visual effects and computer-generated worlds are superb. The cinematography from Ben Davis is also top-notch. Davis did Guardians of the Galaxy just a few years before this, and his work here surpasses the James Gunn flick. Many Marvel movies struggle to achieve the sharp and sleek look that Davis and Derrickson created here. Yes, the editing is not perfect in some of the action sequences, but it rarely ever diminishes the visuals in the film. The story is also very nicely written. The screenwriters did walk the line a bit when it came to being a formulaic movie. However, the powerful visuals and the stellar character development of Strange keep that aspect free of depriving the film. Doctor Strange also manages its core assemblage of characters very well. No character ever feels like they are being hidden or misplaced in a scene. It helps that Doctor Strange is perfectly paced. The editing shines here the most as not one of the scenes in the film was too long or too short. The only nitpick with the script would be with the narrative structure of the film. The ending goes by a bit too fast. The visuals are stunning, and the cast is stellar, yet it feels like the conclusion needed just a few more minutes to capture the character of Dormammu. The cast is the best part of Doctor Strange as the ensemble brings the energy needed to make this film feel more full-of-life when the show-stopping visual effects are on screen. Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal in the lead role as he makes Stephen Strange feel like a character that you would want to witness his new life journey. Plus, Cumberbatch nails the character development of Strange perfectly. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also strong and brings a lot of powerful emotion to his performance. Ejiofor cares about this role, which is nice to see. Rachel McAdams is a delight in this film and sells the woman who only wants the best for her ex-lover, now friend. Benedict Wong is hilarious here and nails down the comedic timing by selling the precise facial expressions at the right time. Mads Mikkelsen is the weakest actor in the cast yet still gives a solid performance that does not lower the film. Finally, Tilda Swinton is great in the role of the Ancient One with a lot of fun emotion that works very well with the energy Cumberbatch has. The only minor problem with the film is that the score from Michael Giacchino is quite bland with scarce stylization to it. Besides that, Doctor Strange is an impeccable film with hardly any blemishes. The visuals are out-of-this-world, and the cast makes this film something incredible. With the pacing being spot on, it is hard not to feel the magic of Doctor Strange. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",25-Oct-21,4,0.064,0.74,0.197,0.9983,,,,,,

Marco B,"A lot of people say Doctor Strange is the best Marvel Movie ever made, or at least one of the top five. If I based this on visuals alone then yes this film would get top spot, however it suffers from leaps in story, character development and even plot timing. It is rather unclear how long Dr. Stephen Strange takes to train, as he goes through the MCU's version of Hogwarts, but it seems he gains powers rather quickly, especially since everyone in his old life doesn't really seem to miss him that much. I like this film, mostly because Tilda Swinton is excellent as The Ancient One but also because we are finally introduced to the mystic side of the MCU. I wish it had been a touch more original; again we have a generic villain with a basic plan, a female love interest whose storyline can not possibly go that far and a hero learning to control his ego and his powers.",16-Sep-21,4,0.079,0.711,0.211,0.9822,,,,,,

Jonathan K,"Doctor Strange, from a plot mechanics approach, is very much in the MCU mold, but outside of that, it's a woefully different creature. It's far more cerebral than any other entry has been, works on deeper philosophical tones (that it puts front-and-center), and uses the same ultra-intellect most recently seen in Sherlock. As my wife and I put it, this is ""The thinking-man's Marvel movie"", but at the same time, it's more of a Modern Sorcery film than it is a Superhero flick, and if not for very quick references to things such as ""Infinity Stones"", then you'd never think that this was a move in the MCU continuity. As for the movie itself, it features a very well-written and very smart protagonist, and how he approaches every situation only reinforces this element; this shouldn't sound like much of a point in itself, but usually, writers either have the plot driven forward by the smart character doing something dumb for once (maybe out of arrogance), or they simply solve problems via internal mental-mechanics ""because they're smart"" (like the cartoon scientist that just goes behind the chalkboard and invents a new ray-gun or transport device that is perfectly situated to the situation at hand). The other characters are smart as well, and how they treat Strange's ego are satisfying. In a sense this is sorta like the original Thor in that it does involve an uber-competent yet intensely-smug that forcefully learns to control their inflated ego, but Doctor Strange's problems aren't actually due to his ego; rather, he learns the hard lessons by experiencing hardships caused by a conflict that he was forcefully thrust into, on a scale beyond his imagining. This still makes his character development quite satisfying as we see him grow due to the increasing severity of the situation, and ultimately this is what the heart of the movie is, rather than the story or the themes (which is amazing this day in age). Now, most people remember the movie for having great CGI, and this is accurate, but it really downplays it significantly -- This is an astonishing work of visual art during these moments, using CGI (and CG altered/replicated instances of physical items) in a way that has never been seen before, and always showing it all to you as clearly and intricately as possible; the fact that it lost Best Visual Effects is an insult. Additionally, the acting is solid across the board, the musical score is soaring, and the Climax is wonderful -- it doesn't cheat using the usual ""I have more power than you"" approach, instead finding a completely new and inventive way of defeating the evil force, and this is what I appreciated most from the movie. It put the pieces into play very carefully for a subversion, and a successful subversion we got. You don't need to be an MCU fan to enjoy this movie - If the idea of 'A sorcerer movie set in modern day New York City' sounds good to you, this movie is a must-see.",11-Aug-21,4.5,0.073,0.763,0.164,0.9957,,,,,,

Cailan D,"Doctor Strange is a thrilling and engaging origin story for Stephen Strange that is well-led by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch perfectly embodies Strange's arrogant and narcissistic personality but via the script is allowed to go through a nice character arc that lays the groundwork for Strange in future MCU movies. The supporting actors do a great job of helping Strange develop and progress as a character, which gives each of them moments to shine and capitalize on their screen time. The fight sequences are above average and are almost certain to keep viewers' eyes glued to the screen. One thing I really appreciated about the movie is that Strange isn't the only character who's allowed to go through an arc. Mordo also goes through some interesting development, which shows that the writers weren't afraid to give a character with less screen time some progression that almost certainly lays the foundation for Mordo's appearances in the future. Lastly, the CGI and special effects are some of the best that we've seen in the MCU so far and set a high bar for other movies in the franchise. I do have two main criticisms of the film, though. First, this origin story has the same structural formula as Iron Man: a wealthy, arrogant, brilliant guy gets into an accident that alters his perspective on the world and makes him change. Doctor Strange is just a CGI and special effects enhanced version of this, meaning it's an origin story we've seen before and doesn't add much to the MCU canon. Also, while all the effects are good, they're bordering on being overused since the film relies so heavily on them and uses so much of them.

The Duke o,"Marvel is at it again with another addition to their ever growing superhero universe. The Scott Derrickson directed story centers around Doctor Stephen Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch, a brilliant neurosurgeon who suffers a crippling injury to his hands. After his pursuit of a cure through conventional medicine fails him, Strange journeys to the far east searching for mystical paths that may hold the key to his recovery. He gets much more than he expects however, when he finds that the power he sought to heal his body can also bend the laws of space time and reality itself. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. This was probably the most ambitious of Marvel's films as it seeks to fold a world of magic and trans-dimensional sorcery into it's cinematic universe. All other Marvel films seem tame by comparison as this is by far the most unique looking film I've seen by a major studio to date. This seriously feels like what would happen if Inception and Avatar: The Last Air Bender had a three way with Enter The Void. If that doesn't peak your interest, I don't know what will. The visuals are mind bending with action scenes that take place across dimensions of space, time and the etheric plane. From a kaleidoscope of twisting buildings to the colorful outer reaches of the outer realm, this movie is literally the closest thing to a psychedelic experience you can get without smoking a Joe Rogen level of DMT. Don't get it twisted, Doctor Strange is no one trick pony. The acting is superb and it's cast which, along with Cumberbatch, includes Rachel McAdams, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton absolutely knock it out of the park. The writing is also a highlight of this film as it successfully balances all the complexities of it's story and visuals with a hefty dose of comedy which gave this movie just the right amount of grounding it needed to keep from being too...well... strange. All in all I really have to give this movie props for taking what is surely the most heady and complex of Marvel's compendium of characters and churning out what may be my favorite Marvel film so far. It's daring, funny, action packed and the visuals will knock the eyeballs out of your head! If you have a chance to see this film in IMAX or God bless, IMAX-3D? Don't hesitate! Doctor Strange conjures up a perfect 5... out of 5.",19-May-21,3.5,0.061,0.804,0.135,0.9909,,,,,,
Kevin P,"This movie is wonderfully trippy and a visual masterpiece. But sadly it's dragged down by the unlikable lead, which is bizarre for such a wonderful actor like Benedict Cumberbatch. But I blame the writing and directing more than him. Doctor Strange isn't a terrible character by any means, but I feel like he movie made him too unlikeable for he first half of the story and didn't give us enough reason to care for him as a character worthy of redemption. At the very least, they could've avoided the bland romantic rekindling that totally felt unearned and kind of gross considering Strange's emotionally abusive lash-out earlier in the movie and the concerning ""He'll be better now I swear"" framing of the situation. It's also a damn shame that we had to settle for an awkward raspy American accent from Benedict Cumberbatch instead of his naturally rich British accent. Tilda Swinton is charming as the mysterious ancient one, but the blatant whitewashing of this Tibetan character is disappointing. I understand that they wanted to avoid stereotypes, but I felt like they could've found a better way around this. That being said, the fight sequences are amazingly vibrant and I adore the creative resolution to defeating the villainous Dormammu. The costuming, set pieces, and side characters are admittedly pretty fun too along with some well-timed bits of humor. I suppose Doctor Strange might just work better as a side character than as a protagonist. Not the best Marvel movie, but it's far from bad and certainly worth a watch for Marvel fans.",5-May-21,3.5,0.189,0.565,0.246,0.9763,,,,,,
Puroo R,"To be honest when I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with the trend after Infinity War, Dr Strange was probably one of those movies I was really looking forward to. I didn't know anything about Dr Strange, but I found him really cool looking (yep, the same thing as Captain America; you can check out my review for The First Avenger if you want). A cool, cape wearing man using magic to open portals and create yellow beams? Count me in! And trust me when I say this movie is even better than what I was expecting it to be. Dr Stephen Strange is just a casual minded, gifted doctor who is filthy rich and a playboy. Basically the medical version of Tony Stark. And after the accident he loses his power of using his hands. The very thing that made him special is taken away from him because of one moment of carelessness. I actually shrieked in pain when I saw his hands stitched. And then seeing him unable to use his hands left me in introspection. I had never realised how much I use my hands to do my everyday things. And then he goes to Kathmandu to get find the sorceress who could heal him. The thieves who came to attack him also left me in introspection - what would I do if something like that happens to me? He is saved by one of the wizards and is taken to the Ancient One. She teaches him to be a wizard. I rarely like the training montages in movies, but this one is an exception, especially when the handless man makes the spiral. The part where he steals the books from the library is also very funny. The hospital fight scene, the portals fight scene and the Dormammu scenes were all fun to watch. A lot happens in the movie and I don't want to give too much detail from it, so I'll just get to what all I like about this movie. The visuals are simply gorgeous, to say the least, the score absolutely suits it, Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Dr Strange is just like his comic counterpart, every scene is fun to watch as it's either funny or engaging and a huge amount of character development happens throughout the movie. Doctor Strange is my favourite MCU movie based on one character, and my second favourite after Avengers: Infinity War.

Harry E,One word came to mind when watching this film. Weird. The character progression for Doctor Strange is cool though feels like a re-use of Tony Stark's arc from Iron Man. The villain is generic with only a few redeeming qualities one being that he is played by Mads Mikkelsen. Tilda Swinton is weird and great but Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong feel unnecessary at times. At some points the film feels badly paced but overall is a great insight into the world of the mystic arts even though the reveal of Dormammu kinda sucked.,11-Apr-21,3.5,0.131,0.745,0.124,0.0489,,,,,,

Wendy M,"This one was a disappointment for me. I love me some Swinton and Cumberbatch...but they felt miscast in this. They lacked the dose of lovability mixed with a pinch of levity combined with a whole lotta heart that these movies and characters require. All Superheroes have their baggage and secrets; the haunting things that we love as they not only rise above them but give the old saying ""what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"" a whole new meaning. Here, though, it is hard to tell if Strange's life altering car accident is the defining obstacle to overcome or his suffocating imperiousness that sucks the oxygen out of a good little chunk of the start of the movie. His insufferable arrogance and obsessive pickiness were left to hang there alone like an irritant...in direct conflict with the comic book character's much more complicated persona. I don't know if it was the writing or direction or they just played it too serious and offbeat for these types of portrayals, but this just missed the mark. I wasn't crazy about it when I saw it in theaters, but as my hubby and I started our nerdfest where we started watching all the MCU movies again according to timeline, I was really struck by how much this one did not stand up to the rest of them. Dr. Strange is a really interesting character in the MCU, but they just did not make him come alive in this flick. A few bright spots were there and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong really added some much needed reprieve from an otherwise dry movie.",23-Mar-21,4,0.123,0.755,0.123,0.6074,,,,,,

Mark B,"Christopher Nolan wants to make an MCU movie. No, seriously. Stay with me as I map this out. After Doctor Strange's director Scott Derrickson riffed on Inception with the city scapes folding over each other, I think Nolan decided do him one better after watching the finale and was like ""Eureka -- backwards time fights! I think I'll call it -- Tenet!"" Joking. Maybe. Anyway, Doctor Strange again beats expectations by taking one of the more fantastical Marvel characters and making his origin story interesting. I actually think that's the formula for the more ""out-there"" comic adaptions. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, make the characters and cinematography so captivating you don't need to suspend disbelief as we're just riding along with the eye candy. Benedict Cumberbatch get's to go FULL ASSHOLE as Strange, a guy so narcissistic he gives Donald Trump a run for his money. Tilda Swinton is always great as the bald headed ""master."" And then there's Mads Mikkelsen who is so underutilized in his glitter eye-makeup its criminal. As pointed out by Mads expert @harlenquincade, he did have a good look in that S&M metal body cage.

He likes action, I like spirituality, and we both like mind benders so this was perfect. AND THE EASTER EGG WITH STAN LEE WAS AWESOME!!! One of my top pros about the movie was that it wasn't biased on a romance either, and the characters motives weren't about their significant other or relationship. They had their own lives and they weren't codependent upon each other, no damsel in distress bs either. Some cons were that we couldn't hear what the actors were saying sometimes but in other scenes we had to turn the volume down unfortunately.

shawn d,"Doctor Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon and one of the best in his field, but a man engorged in his own ego. After a tragic accident driving his high end sports car, his fingers are totally mangled leaving him lost and he loses his profession from being unable to preform the work. Strange is then plunged into obsession to fix his hand unsuccessfully, this bleeds him dry. Yearning to apply his gifts he seeks out guidance which lands him in Nepal where he learns to use the strength of his mind to heal his body with the help from the mythic arts he is able to tap into his metaphysical abilities giving him the sort of purpose that not even his past profession could even fathom. Once Strange is introduced to the Ancient one, he must once again focus on his skill and any deductions he notices to tap into the depths of his being in order to overcome this intensive power struggle. This is by far some of the prettiest visuals you'll see in a Marvel film its quite honestly top notch in my opinion. The cast also a great strength of the film in my humble opinion Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play a Marvel superhero i mean that name is pretty badass and really iconic already. The roots of this film ties into the entire Marvel universe so beautifully.

Henry A,"Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, throws us Marvel fans a complete curve ball, with his execution and style, but it paid off well! With Doctor Strange having a tough back story to sculpt into frame, Derrickson and the creative team made the best out of it, creating this inventive, mind bending film, with so many twist and turns, while involving new and creative ideas. Sadly, the biggest issue of the film, is the story. This, by the numbers premise, has been used and abused many times by the MCU. Derrickson created some great potential for a new world building opportunity, with a pace that doesn't have a lot of downtime to play around, but because of the clunky scene structure, choppy pace, and surplus of exposition, a lot of events and characters went underdeveloped; If this film was another fifteen minutes longer, it would've allowed for developing in their weak spots. Scott Derrickson didn't shy away from giving us that darker tone, involving decent risks, but when they tried to tone things down, the conflicting tones didn't mesh well with eachother. Benedict Cumberbatch was the saving grace of the film. He absolutely steals every scene he's in, bringing this tremendous amount of snarky wit and range to the character. Although he is a likable character, he reminds me of a generic Tony Stark, that just tried to capture his charisma, but he wasn't as interesting or exuberant. His character development was fine, but it was ran through so quickly, that the time frame just didn't add up. His love interest, for lack of better terms, in Rachel McAdams is fine; she serves her purpose, but she's pretty forgettable, not having much to do in the film. She tankfully wasn't over saturated, but the casting choice itself was a little much, riding the cusp of being disposable. Tilda Swinton is another casting that was a little over done, but she fits the role really well. Her character is complex, yet subtle, having a few interesting aspects to her character and backstory, but due to her character being slightly underdeveloped, we didn't get as much as we could've from her. Chiwetel Ejiofor was another solid addition to the film, putting on a good performance, but he didn't add that much, other than some exposition. Mads Mikkelsen put on a good performance as Kaecilius, being a real intense presence, but I needed much more on his character. We got a little backstory on him, but everything felt very forced, and fast with his character, that he just didn't get the development he deserved. The screenplay by Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts, and C. Roberts Cargill, had a tough time balancing everything, between the story, the characters, and the humor. They had a few high points, but the humor took me out of the film, due to it being really forced. This was most definitely one of the best looking films of the MCU! There was so many great colors and visuals that just pop off the screen, with immaculate detail and style. With this being a real effects-heavy film, it was one of the driving forces, being seamlessly crafted! The action of the film was fun, but it wasn't handled the greatest, lacking good shots and creative fight sequences. Overall, Doctor Strange is a real fun, and inventive film, but it doesn't come without flaws. Doctor Strange is one of the better films of the MCU, but it isn't one of those blockbuster hits like some of these other titles are.",17-Jun-20,4,0.085,0.722,0.194,0.9979,,,,,,

It'my favourite movie from Marvel universe. Second movie is telling us about Peter Quill and his company's adventures after events in the first part. This time Peter has accidently meeted his real father from other planet. After Ego(Peter's father) has told to Peter about himself and about his plans, Peter with his friends have understood, that Ego is one of the most danderous of villains in the universe and his plans can have terrible consequences for universe. The Guardians of galaxy vol.2 is very realistic Thanks to technologies, which Marvel studios used. Other stars, planets, aliens and starships is fancy and look as if they were real.

Kyle E,"Having really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which was not quite as good as the hype but still very good, expectations were high for the sequel while being a little worried as to whether it would be as good or disgrace the first. The good news is that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' does not disgrace the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and is actually just as good. Like as was said with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is it as amazing as the IMDb rating (which is something that really shouldn't be taken to heart and is often blown out of proportion here on IMDb) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' well made and entertaining? Absolutely. A couple of the gags fall a little flat and the film does drag in the middle act. That's pretty much it for the complaints however. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2', reiterating what was said in my review for the first film due to having the same strengths, boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic, really making the toes tap. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much. James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at. Both 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films are far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction are in them as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' was written too, most of the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart. The story is mostly energetic and compelling, let down only by some of the middle act. At least however it doesn't have as many random misplaced moments and over sentimentality, even if it's not exactly original (not that that is a desperately bad thing). Characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character, but it's adorable and hilarious Baby Groot, scene-stealing Rocket and touchingly conflicted Yondu steal the show. Once again, like in the first film, Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Baby Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocket. Kurt Russell is an enigmatic presence and Michael Rooker is quite touching as Yondu. In conclusion, a lot of fun and very well made, every bit as good as the first, a few flat jokes and draggy middle aside. 8/10 Bethany Cox",14-Mar-22,4.5,0.088,0.674,0.238,0.9987,,,,,,

Bradley W,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 follows up the story from the first film exactly how it is expected. The film has a better story and a better villain than the first, but character development ends up taking a step back. With the sudden flanderization of the team, the only character to really survive this sudden change is Yondu who gets a lot of good development as a result. The sudden change in Rocket can also be excused as he gets some development to explain it, but no one else really has an explanation to his or her drastically changed personalities in this film. This does not ruin the film, but it does leave a slight scar on it when watching it again, especially nearly back to back with the original. Like the first film I suggest watching this film again, but it doesn't have any real bearing on the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole so for those doing a necessities only marathon, this movie can be left alone.",16-Dec-21,5,0.05,0.848,0.102,0.8795,,,,,,

Nathan D,"This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film. Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top.

Jonathan K,"The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart. And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel ""this is funny"" or ""this is cool"", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad. The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie. The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is. Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got. If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time. You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed. In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",29-Jul-21,3,0.103,0.637,0.26,0.9953,,,,,,

Cailan D,"GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the ""sequel is worse"" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his ""new"" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",23-Jul-21,3,0.047,0.686,0.267,0.9984,,,,,,

Puroo R,"After the release of Infinity War, I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with everyone before Endgame comes. And of course I was watching them all very hurriedly. The memorable movies were the ones that I still remember very clearly to date (it's been nearly 3 years), while the ones that were terrible and a drag to watch, I forgot them instantly. I'd say this movie comes between the two categories, and as far as I can think right now, it's the only one to be in this exceptional category. No matter what everyone says, I absolutely hate baby Groot. Cuteness only suits on creatures we are used to perceiving as cute. And thus Groot, a tree, looks very, very awkward with those chubby cheeks. It seems as though that face wasn't meant to be on that body. Also the entire point of his innocence is very irritating, especially the part where he wanted to use Rocket's buttons in spite of him repeatedly telling him not to do it. That scene does not even make any sense, since other than that part Rocket and Groot seem to understand each other literally all the time. Groot becomes stupid or intelligent, strong or weak as the story demands it, which is why I absolutely hate him. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Though it feels as though there is too much yellow in the colour palette and the overall tone is more inclined towards the warm shades, the CGI world is marvelous to look at. Ego is a great planet to look at. I have seen Ego in the comics now so I can't believe they were actually able to translate him so well on the screen. Seeing the spaceship battles always kept me on the edge of my seat. It's just like how I was expecting the movie to become better as time progresses. But the way the conflict between Peter and Ego came was very bad. First of all, the way they bonded was wrong by their characteristics. Peter is a gullible guy who always thinks by his emotions while Gamora is the sensible one. Yet here Peter was the one suspecting Ego while Gamora wanted him to trust Ego. And then the way Ego revealed his mother's death, ugh! Why did he even need to say that! Firstly no matter how much you are in a flow, you'd never say something like that. And secondly if he knows so much about Peter, how did he not know saying that would make him angry? I really liked Mantis. I never understood why her character arc was about her being ugly. She looked way better than Nebula or Drax. She was kinda cute though. I couldn't hear any of Drax's jokes so I won't be talking about him. Yondu was also a very nice character. As much as I rolled my eyes seeing him in the movie, I really enjoyed seeing what he had become. His character development is fantastic, because of the redeemed person that he is. His whistling and shooting arrows was very much fun to watch. Overall this movie is a very mixed bag of opinions for me. I think it's really bad compared to the first movie, but at the same time really entertaining compared to most MCU movies. There is so much CGI, so much world building in GotG that I can't possibly hate it. I'm just gonna try to remember this one. I had forgotten everything about it except the good scenes, so I had to watch the Cinemasins video to remember it. I hope Volume 3 surpasses my expectations.",22-May-21,0.5,0.111,0.765,0.125,0.8262,,,,,,

Jerry S,"Everyone Always say it's either Guardians of the Galaxy, or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. For me, I really do like both of them. They are both good in a lot of ways and they both have a lot of flaws in a lot of ways. So let's get the flaws out of the way. For me the problem with this movie is how they handle Drax. For me I feel like they could've developed Drax a tad bit better. He has some really good moments with Mantis, and he can be pretty funny through most of it, but honestly sometimes he can get kinda annoying with his laugh but sometimes the laugh works. Another problem that I have with this movie is that some of it could be cut down just a little bit, and there are a few scenes that kinda feel like they don't have to be there. But otherwise. This movie rocks. I really like the history between Quill and his father. The relationship between Gamora and Nebula was really interesting, and as I said earlier some of the scenes between Drax and Mantis were really good. But by far my favorites scenes to watch are between Rocket and Yandu. These characters were so engaging. Just their history just really interest me and somewhat moved me. They were hands down my favorite parts of watching the film. I also thought Ego was much more of an interesting villain than Ronan. All in all Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not perfect but still a really good movie. I don't think that I'll ever have a favorite between these but for me I'm kinda leading towards Guardians of the Galaxy but at the end there are stuff that I really like in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but I guess I'll never know which movie that I prefer. 8.5/10",9-May-21,3,0.055,0.739,0.206,0.995,,,,,,

The ending to this is also entertaining. Chris Pratt and Co. are just as enjoyable as before, with Dave Bautista particularly standing out to me here; if only due to his amusing moments. I like the addition of Pom Klementieff, I can see a spot for her in the crew. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Debicki make for contrasting newcomers, Russell is just about good but I felt Debicki and her lot were underused/unintriguing. Not the most compelling plot, which I found more predictable than what the MCU usually produces, but the strong action end and noteworthy humour elevates it to become a pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original.",21-Jan-21,3.5,0.024,0.692,0.284,0.9948,,,,,,

Like the its predecessor, this is both funny and surprisingly heartfelt, considering the chaotic world of the Guardians. There is some wonderful character work in this. (The cast is great across the board.) I appreciate how much this feels like a natural extension of the first. So rarely do films and their character arcs have such clear progression. There are a couple issues I had. It felt like Drax (Dave Bautista) was dumbed down. Also, I like new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff), but there is the issue of the changes to her character in comparison to the original comics. Writer and director James Gunn has a fondness for making big changes to comic characters. Usually that works. Here, however, here we have a martial artist female hero transformed into a meeker, more reactive-than-proactive character; problematic. The whole thing looks great. The first film was distinctive, but this one raises the bar. The sci-fi designs are colorful and creative. The CGI in this is amazing. Really, I think this one of the greatest visual attempts in film. James Gunn's direction and incorporation of classic songs works so well. Overall, I can't stress how good this is.

Yes it drags but I love those portions as it settles the characters much more, much more dialogues and character moments. It also doesn't throw the villain at your face but builds relationships. Baby Groot is cute, Rocket does everything we loved about that character from first one. Rocket-Groot bomb sequence is one of my favourite sequence this movie is filled with many other comedy gold. Drax comedy is still my favourite, Peter having sexual emotion for Gamora and Drax screaming top of his lungs cracked me the most. Drax and Mentis just starting their weird relation. Gamora & Nebula's bonding thickens with fantastic toxic sister-sister relationships were explored. Peters relationship with his Father, being set up as a alien in first movie got good continuity and explains a lot more about Peter getting kidnapped by Ravengers.

David A,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters. One of the best things that James Gunn did for this film, was not only flesh out all of the characters, but give them such a grounded tone, being able to mesh with the other Avengers seamlessly. With this film being centered around Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, again, we were able to dig deeper into his back story, and discover a lot of great layers to his character. He had so much to do, carrying the load on his shoulders, leaving him with the best character arch of the film. Zoe Sladana returns as Gamora, and she absolutely kills it this time! With her character being involved with a drastic plot point, it left her character to be fleshed out more, while becoming more grounded than before. Karen Gillan as Nebula got a lot more to do this time around, really giving herself, and Gamora the extra excitement and importance they both needed. We really didn't get too much more on Drax, played by Dave Bautista, but every time that man opens his mouth, it's comedy gold! With the nice addition of Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, it helped flesh his character out, subtly. Michael Rooker as Yondu, is the MAN! He gets so much more to do this time around, fleshing his character out nicely. His character is just so well written, allowing for great character moments. With Groot being pushed to the side, it allowed for Rocket Racoon, played by Bradley Cooper, to gain a tremendous bond with Yondu. The banter between these two characters was absolutely gut-busting! Rocket also has one of the better character archs of the film, fleshing his character out more, while keeping that charm everyone loves. I'm a fan of Kurt Russell, and I really liked him in the MCU, but the writters didn't give him enough space to breath, and be Kurt Russell. Even though he has one of the best back stories for a villain, while also posing a real threat, his character development was predictable. If James Gunn let him do his thing, I feel as if this film could've benefited from that Kurt Russell charisma. The issue this film had, it tried too incorporate too many villains, making everyone underdeveloped, and a waste of potential. Guardians 2 didn't rely on the action like the first film, but the few times it's there, it's super exciting, well shot, and backed up with immaculate effects. This is one of the MCU's best looking films. You didn't think that they would make a sequel and not absolutely kill it on the soundtrack again, did you? James Gunn and Tyler Bates came together once more to create another amazing soundtrack, that enhanced the emotion and tention in each scene. Overall, even though James Gunn ran into a few more issues than the first, he still managed to create a real fun experience!",17-Jun-20,2.5,0.032,0.758,0.21,0.9994,,,,,,

Beni Z,"This is controversially one of the worst MCU movies of all time. The movie was funny, but all the other things that were good in the first movie, were thrown away in the second. The dynamic between the characters is my favorite part about the guardians. So i was really bummed, that they split up the gang for half of the movie. The movie is still charming, watchable and enjoyable for sure. I still don't understand what they tried to do with the villain. This was supposed to be one of the most emotional fights in the MCU, but the execution leaves me wanting more. The biggest part of the movie they didn't even know, that he was a villain. In the end they save this movie with the comedy and Yondu. Yondu was my favorite character in this movie by far.

Kyle E,"Really enjoyed the first two films, both contained great scenes/action, acting and the two best villains of the films. Was mixed on the third film, which wasn't that bad but suffered mainly from bloat, and was not totally sold on the 'Amazing Spider-Man' films. Whether 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is the best 'Spider-Man' film ever is debatable, some may prefer the first two films, others may prefer this. To me, it is the best 'Spider-Man' film since the second and on par with the first two. It may not have taken as many risks or had sequences/action as memorable as the first two films, and for more of an origin story it's best to stick with the first two films. For a fresh twist on 'Spider-Man' and the superhero genre, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (one of Marvel's best to date) more than fits the bill. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is not quite the masterpiece as proclaimed to me and maybe not quite as good as the acclaim, but personally can totally see why it is loved so much and that it deserves all the positivity it's received. It has a couple of faults, Liz is a bland and underwritten character and Laura Harrier does nothing with the character. Flash also could have been much more intimidating in demeanour and physicality, for a bully one is not intimidated, pretty anaemic actually and even annoying at times. Much more could have been done with Spider-Man's powers and how he got around, they could have been better used, being not used enough, and of better quality. However, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' looks great. Slick, stylish with bold, atmospheric use of colour and mostly top-notch special effects. Michael Giacchino pens yet another winner of a music score, both rousing and hypnotic with also an intensity and emotional undercurrent. It's a remarkably well scripted film too. It has some hilarious and rarely forced humour (namely from Ned and Michelle, both of whom should have been annoying but were refreshing scene-stealing comic relief), poignancy and tension. The story works well as a superhero story, with great chemistry between Peter and Tony Stark and a terrific scene in a car with our hero and Vulture, and even more so as an affectionate and easy to relate to coming of age and trying-to-fit-in story. The action is kept at minimum but what there is is fun and suspenseful, even if there were sequences and climaxes more memorable in the first two films. A risk was taken having Jon Watts in the director's chair, but luckily inexperience doesn't show, there is a great sense of visual style and momentum is kept taut. A great cast also helps, with Tom Holland doing a wonderful job in the complex dual role, both roles are easy to relate to and he differentiates the two personalities of nerdy, awkward high school deadline and charismatic head-line-making superhero with remarkable ease. Michael Keaton, fresh from giving two of his best performances in years in 'Birdman' and 'Spotlight', is also superb as Vulture, a refreshingly different and more complex villain than most Marvel villains, a menacing villain but with a humane side with a far less generic motivation than one would find in other Marvel films and doesn't feel underused. A villain that one is intimidated by but also feel sorry for. Marissa Tomei seemed bizarre casting on paper but she is very charming actually and fits well. Robert Downey Jnr brings charismatic intensity and authority to Tony Stark, Jon Favreau is fun while Jacob Batalon and Zendaya are refreshing comic relief. Overall, very good, often great and very nearly outstanding (which it would have been if more care was given to a few of the supporting characters). 8/10 Bethany Cox",13-Mar-22,3,0.11,0.626,0.264,0.9993,,,,,,

Darius K,"The good stuff - This movie bypassed the whole origin story of how Parker became Spider-Man. We've already seen that several times with Toby Mcguire and Garfield as well as the several recounts in the comic books. We get it. Bitten by a radioactive spider - summed up in a one line that Parker tells Ned in the movie. So lets look at the actors from a positive - This new dude is definitely convincing as a newbee Spidey. And then we have Michael Keaton as the ultimate villain in the movie. The vulture - yes, Keaton is now old enough to portray Toombs as the Vulture. Of course we all remember him as Bruce Wayne/ Batman in the original and awesome Tim Burton Batman movies, as well as Jack Frost in the Christmas favorite. Keaton brings a depth to the character - a down to earth business owner struggling to make ends meet who gains a city contract to clean up the mess caused during the first Avengers movie. Only, he gets ousted by Tony Stark AFTER his signed contract. So what would make reality end the movie there and then? The fact that he could sue the city, the federal government and Stark for the cost of the contract and much more. Only the writers ignore normal legal protocol and decide to suddenly make Keaton into the supervillain called Vulture. Okay, so far, apart from that break in reality, I'm fine with it, since Keaton is a great actor and continues to perform in a formidable way as Adrian Toombs/The Vulture. There is even a somewhat altruistic reasoning behind his motivation - he has a family and he needs to provide for the men he hired. Action in the movie: the sequences are great - it would have been a fantastic film if it were just the action scenes and the story minus the human part. And the 3D was definitely worth it. Maybe it WAS converted post-filming, but who cares - the scenes still add that additional feel to the viewer. Now the minuses - Disney and its diversity! I'm not for diversity in a movie but when it gets ridiculous, that's when I draw the line. Why ridiculous - starting from the opening scene of Parker entering his school, there seems to be more Asian and Black people than white guys in this mediocre NY High School. Has Peter Parker got a scholarship for high school in an institutional reserved for minorities, if not, then, are white straight guys the minority? Who knows what the director was thinking? Now we are introduced to Liz Allen. Now to comic aficionados, she is a blonde white girl who Parker had a crush on before he became Spider-Man, and to whom he stayed friends with throughout college. He never ended up with the girl, since his best friend Harry Osborn had the hots for her and ultimately married her. In fact Harry and Liz had a kid together named ""Normie"". Of course, with diversity taking a stand, she is now a black chick and to make diversity even stronger, she is a product of a white dad and a black mom. Then we see Michelle, who has a resting bitch face/similar attitude and is of Mulatto ethnicity. No problems there, just another diverse character who seems to pop up in Parker's life frequently. Of course we find out that she is now supposed to be the new MJ. What happened to the gorgeous red-head? Based on a lot of Hollywood remakes/reboots/sequels, they hate red-heads, I think. I mean, just take a look at our favorite mermaid, Ariel. Now we see Parker's best friend, Ned Leeds. The actor chosen was an Asian-Hawaiian, and a fat guy to boot. Ned Leeds in the comic books was an ace reporter until he was not, then got seduced by the dark side and became the Hobgoblin. And he was Betty Brant's husband. Betty Brant, as the young white blonde TV school reporter in the movie (who was actually a sexy brunette). Okay - so we have a race swapped MJ, Ned Leeds and Liz Allen. Think it stopped there - no! Flash Thompson is the muscular and masculine white jock who constantly bullies Parker (partly owning to the difference in their physiques and partly that Parker is a geek while Flash is all brawn). So this muscular white bully is changed into a weedy little Guatemalan who bullies through wisecracks rather than brawn and who may be as geeky as Parker since he too is on the Academic Decathlon team. And mind you, Tom Holland definitely has the brawn when compared to the physique of Flash actor Tony Revolori. So lets forget the people and think about the suit: - the first suit that Peter wore seemed reminiscent of the Scarlet Spider who was not a Parker clone but the real deal in the end. That was cool. However, the Stark suit makes Spider-man more into an Iron-Man - a suit with AI and tech that the actual Spider-Man never had. What's more is that Tom Holland seems to rely more on the tech than his actual abilities. In the comics and in the original films, Parker tested out his abilities and slowly honed them through time. Here, the boy was merely following the direction of the suit. And the scene on the Manhattan ferry where he spider-webbed the ferry together seemed to closely resemble the original movie where Toby stopped the train and the public cheered for him. The McGuire scene was heartfelt but no scene in this movie had that level of feeling. The Villains - As I said before, Michael Keaton brought a certain credibility to the movie and his acting was flawless. But with the diversity kick, you have him married to a black woman and lo and behold - Liz Allen the blonde white girl is actual his black daughter. That scene tried to bring some feeling into the film but it failed miserably. In fact there it could have been saved if both parties didn't know who they were dealing with or if only Keaton knew the truth. Then there's the Shocker - comic book fans will know him to be one of Spidey's longtime major villains, although never quite in the league of the Green Goblin or Doc Ock. Yet, while the writers had an opportunity to key him into the story as a major player, he was discarded - twice - first the white guy was not good enough for even Keaton and was killed off, then the black dude played the part which was easily forgetful - outsmarted by a fat kid with no experience wielding a web-shooter. Now some underlying thought - Peter Parker in the comic books had a father figure to look up to - that was his uncle Ben, who taught him the proper values in life. When Peter, drunk with the power of his newly found abilities let a crook escape, which led to the ultimate death of Uncle Ben, realised the enormity of his mistake, he started to take his responsibility a bit more seriously. In this movie, there was none of that. Parker keeps playing around with no regard to the consequences. One may be fooled that the scene in the bodega may have snapped him to his senses, but we saw that neither the owner nor his cat were hurt. So he hand nothing on his conscience. And the only man he has to look up to is Tony Stark, who funnily enough is doing his best as trying to teach responsibility to a kid. Then we have a young, hot and sexy Aunt May. I could perhaps live with that, except that of course even the actress Marissa Tomei regrets her decision after signing on the dotted line when she realises who Aunt May is really supposed to be. Mind you, Aunt May is actually Parker's motivation for doing what he does in the comic books - he wants to live up to Uncle Ben's reputation, and he wants to keep her safe. Now there is one other thing - coming from the leftist bracket. Our Mulatto MJ makes a comment that the Washington Monument was built by slaves and a black security guard agrees with her over the learned teacher of Parker's class. Yes - Slaves were emancipated in 1862 and slavery was still legal in district of Columbia in 1848 when construction began. The monument was built with high quality stone and used stonemasons for its carving - a specialized craft that slaves were not familiar with. The stones were hoisted by steam engines which again were in the realm of skilled engineers and not education afforded to by slaves. That same went for the cast iron staircase. However, if we go down the lines to the lowest common denominator, then yes, perhaps slaves were working in the quarry. But then the same can be said of any thing today - the lowest common denominator are the ones producing the raw materials and they dont get paid as much as those on the higher rungs - eg. the poor laborer pulping the wood for paper isn't getting the same recognition as the author of the novel whose publisher uses the same paper for its printing. The miners who help in the manufacture of the tin cans do not get the same recognition of the artist who uses those paint tins while painting. The fact that slaves may have worked in the quarry is merely a reflection of the times. All in all, the movie is good if you ignore the drama and the concentrate on the action. And of course if you're not a reader of the comics, then the movie is a treat.",26-Jan-22,3.5,0.083,0.796,0.121,0.996,,,,,,
Random D,"While Tom Holland is a great actor and solid cast, the bright and bubbly vibe of this movie doesn't really hide the slight mischaracterisation of Spider-Man in this very MCU prominent world. Even the villian cares more about Iron Man than Spidey, like c'mon. The love interest is quite useless and theres absolutely no chemistry. This movie almost would have worked without one.

Here we don't see a Peter Parker working for Oscorp or trying to make end meets by selling photos of himself to the Daily Bugle, no, here Peter Parker is a teenager like any other just trying to get good grades at school while struggling with the fact that he possesses superpowers (as if the teenage years weren't hard enough!). On the other hand we have The Vulture, the total opposite of Peter Parker, a grown man trying to provide for his family no matter the cost, at least that's what he tells to himself. The Vulture wasn't messing around, he threatened Peter with a gun, he tried to kill him by letting a building fall over him, and he brutally beat him (with the intend to kill him) in the final battle, remember this is a grown man trying to kill a kid in multiple occassions, that's way darker than the average Marvel movie. Writting alone makes of this movie a great among the greats, but the acting take it to a whole other level, special mention to Tom Holland and Michael Keaton, but the rest of the cast was splendid too.

Philip H,"Great set of actors involved and has it's good moments, sure. I miss some origin story, extra information about how he became Spider-man maybe? Tom Holland is a good pick for Spider-man and he plays it very well, but where is the struggle? Only struggle i see is that he misses Iron-man and his high-tech suit.. I might be becoming too old? but i just don't like this high-tech Spider-man suit, seems too overpowered to me. Also what i really dislike is the bad writing : when Peter meets the bad guy in real life, like there is nothing more subtle he could do to show he knows who the bad guy is. Just seems really odd to me how he reacts to this. Also sometimes i really get the feeling this is written for 12 year olds and younger (younger crowds sell more product). The story is somewhat alternative, no MJ, no uncle Ben, no Harry Osborn and that's okay but it creates a complete different Peter Parker since it where the closest people to him creating the story of Spider-man and who he is. Now the character is written somewhat hollow and the movie is depending more on Tom Hollands likeable and funny character and lot's of CGI.",23-Dec-21,2,0.178,0.705,0.117,-0.9581,,,,,,

Nathan D,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a phenomenal film with a realistic aspect that is hard to find in other superhero movies. The film consists of a total of six screenwriters. I guess that is the lucky number because this script is immaculate. Everything fits so nicely, and the story progresses at a reasonable pace. Plus, the characters have perfectly written storylines. There is enough information to suffice proper character arcs. Yet, it leaves plot details to get explored in the third act. The realism factor in this MCU installment just further enhances the plot points. Yes, the near destruction of the Washington Monument is not realistic, but it is far better than the destruction of New York. When I say realism, it is all about the characters. Peter Parker seems like any other fifteen-year-old boy who dreams of becoming a superhero but still has his defining traits. Peter has a quirky personality and is on the school decathlon team, yet he wants to make sure that he saves the citizens of Queens. Liz is a genuine love interest. She is not overly popular or snobby but still has those popular characteristics that make her stand out from other female love interests in other films. Michelle Jones, or MJ as some of her ""friends"" call her, is made so differently than various incarnations. Yet, it works so well because clearly, MJ wants to fit in more. Supporting these stellar character arcs are some powerful and fun actors. Tom Holland takes charge of the screen in a powerful yet lighthearted nature. His high-pitched voice and fitting facial expressions bring life to the character of Peter Parker. Holland takes the characteristics from the script and applies them in his flawless performance. While I have seen him in his other films, Michael Keaton is hard to separate from Vulture. An element of his performance that takes me out of the story at times. However, Keaton has one scene that works so well where he, Holland, and Laura Harrier all make for one withstanding sequence. Harrier is fantastic here, with her line delivery matching Holland's energy. Zendaya produces a scene-stealer performance as MJ due to her one-liners being hilarious. Jacob Batalon is great as Ned and makes for a worthy counterpart to Holland. Marisa Tomei delivers an amusing performance as Aunt May. Tomei captures the essence of her character in a compelling yet enthusiastic way. Jon Favreau is the best he has ever been as Happy Hogan with hysterical line delivery. Lastly, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. Yes, his role is minimal here, but Downey knows how to make an impact. The technical elements in Spider-Man: Homecoming stop the film from being flawless. The visual effects are rough as the computer-generated suit is not the best-looking. Plus, it is obvious when a green screen is present. The cinematography is also a slight letdown as the shots are not very innovative and sometimes give away what might be heading into the scene. The score from Michael Giacchino, on the other hand, is fantastic. Many tracks are lively, and the cohesiveness throughout each track makes the film feel even more complete. Spider-Man: Homecoming does not disappoint with its flawless script and remarkable cast. Tom Holland leads this film with great force, and he shows that he can be a lead to any movie. Yes, the visual effects and cinematography can be distracting at times. However, Spider-Man makes a splashy solo film debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Tom Holland follows in the footsteps of Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield, two terrific rendition of the role, and make it his own. It's a young, fun and relatable portrayal of Peter Parker. And having our friendly neighbourhood Spider-man fight an ordinary, run-of-the-mill crook to prove himself to Ironman is pure genius. It goes with everything that is Spider-man.

Also getting to see a Spider-Man that isn't ready to be Spider-Man is a nice change, as the previous movies they jump into the role almost immediately after getting their powers and by the time their first villain shows up they are ready for action. In Spider-Man Homecoming though we don't get an origin story, but a story of a hero trying to find his true place in this universe, and comes to terms with the fact he isn't ready for the big fights, and he is ok with that.",16-Dec-21,5,0.11,0.742,0.148,0.7687,,,,,,

Pedro G,"Muy buena película, un comienzo muy bueno que se siente diferente y fresco al estar en el universo de Marvel. Lo mejor de la película es que es super divertida, en ningún momento aburre y siempre entretiene con su historia. La historia esta buena, me gusta que se hayan salteado el origen tan conocido de Spider-man para ya poder contarnos alguna aventura del personaje. El cast esta regular, Tom Holland me parece una excelente elección para Peter Parker/Spider-man, es nerd, ansioso, joven, etc. me gusta mucho su actuación en este papel, realmente esta muy bien. Después esta su mejor amigo Ned, interpretado por Jacob Batalon, el cual me parece un buen personaje que sirve como alivio cómico y que es de lo mejor de la cinta. El interés romántico de Peter es Liz, interpretada por Laura Harrier, el cual es un personaje que a pesar de que no se lo desarrolla mucho ni se indaga en su relacion con Peter, cumple. La tía de Peter, interpretada por Marisa Tomei, una elección muy mala porque es obvio que una actriz tan joven para este papel no queda, no llega a ser tan importante para Peter como otras interpretaciones del personaje y no me convence. Luego esta el grupo de estudiantes de la escuela, entre ellos Flash Thompson, Betty Brant y MJ, entre otros, interpretados por Tony Revolori, Angourie Rice y Zendaya, otra muy mala elección de cast para estos personajes, sin parecerse para nada a los comics y siendo muy tontos como en el caso de Flash. El principal villano de la historia es Adrian Toomes/Buitre, interpretado por Michael Keaton, quien hace un excelente trabajo con este villano, siendo uno de mis favoritos de los live action de Spider-man, ya que su historia es muy interesante y el vinculo que tiene con Peter esta muy bien construido, sorprendiendo a mitad de la historia y generando una tensión tremenda; además, su diseño me gusto mucho. Por ultimo esta Tony Stark/Iron Man que sale en algunas escenas de la película haciendo el papel del mentor de Peter, el cual no me gusto mucho ya que prefería una historia del personaje sin depender de él, pero su inclusión se entiende. El humor de la película me parece que esta bastante bien y es uno de los puntos mas divertidos del film. El traje de Spider-man no me convence del todo ya que el CGI utilizado creo que no le queda tan bien. Por otro lado, las escenas de acción están muy buenas y con unos efectos especiales muy bien logrados. El Spider-man de esta película me parece muy bueno, siendo muy chistoso en sus enfrentamientos, pero poniéndose serio en algunos momentos también. En conclusión, una buena película del personaje que esta por delante de algunas de las otras hechas y que se siente como un fresco y divertido comienzo para la saga establecida en el UCM.

Jorge M,"As a MCU film is an entertaining trip around the new world of Tom Holland's Spider-Man, using the same formula of this universe franchise. It has great moments like the ferry scene and the plane scene, and that plot twist is so tense and shocking. The vulture is an excellent villain, his background is one of the most envelopment in all the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a concept, but not really like a visual spectacle, maybe just at the end. As a Spider-Man film is the less styling of all, it has a lot of changes that loses all the background of the character, you can't really empathize with Spider-Man, because this changes move us out of our comfort zone to take us to an awkward and inconvenient zone. The editing and the cinematography feels so weird and frantic and not to mention that the script is full of conveniences. - RATING - As a MCU film = 8/10 As a Spider-Man film = 6/10",14-Dec-21,3,0.132,0.783,0.085,-0.8073,,,,,,

Jean L,"Spiderman Homecoming is the MCU reboot of Spiderman starring British actor Tom Holland as the webslinger. This reboot does much better than the Andrew Garfield one. Marc Webb here with the help of Kevin Feige of Marvel bring Spiderman which is owned by Sony into the Marvel Cinematic universe in a standalone film that is fun and exciting although not always as inventive. Hollands Spidey is different from the previous ones in that he is younger with a baby face giving spiderman more of a childish portrayal but not in a bad way. He is paired with up and comer Jacob Batalon who is there as Ned who is Peter's best friend serving as comic relief. Zendaya stars as an MJ who is totally different from the iconic portrayal since in here she is black, blunt, kind of a nerd, and full of insults. This shows that once again Spiderman is rebooted and is reinvented so it feels new and mostly it works with a script that's full of soul and good humor. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is great as Keaton always delivers satisfying performances and his villain is grounded. Finally Robert Downey Jrs small role as Iron Man and Peter's mentor serves really well to anchor this new spider man in his new role as an avenger. Is filled with great action, cool scenes, great humor, and a childlike spirit that makes it worthy of the spiderman legacy and a good beginning for this iteration of the character.",10-Dec-21,3,0.057,0.703,0.24,0.9954,,,,,,

Idro S,"Where this film succeeds is in its rich story. Tom Holland does very well in his portrayal of both Spiderman and Peter Parker, and the villain, played by Michael Keaton, is one of the more memorable villains in the MCU. However, the main issue I have with this film is that Spiderman never feels like his own hero, just like Tony Stark's shadow, up until the end of course. Even the villain, however, doesn't even have any conflict with Peter, he just feels like a villain that would fight against the Avengers, or more specifically, Tony Stark. I feel like the film relied too much on Tony Stark and never came out of his shadow. The film in general, however, was still fun to watch and it's one that I've seen several times, it's just that there are a few issues that I have with it.",15-Nov-21,4,0.167,0.725,0.107,-0.8528,,,,,,

Strummer R,"My favourite Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's version of the hero is the most human between the main trio (him, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield). He's a real teenager: anxious, acts by impulse, he's the Spider-Man who most want to be a hero. Most people complain that Tony Stark replaced Uncle Ben in MCU. I completely disagree. When Peter met Tony he already was Spider-Man by around six months. Uncle Ben has already died and Stark was someone who gave Peter a purpose. His turnaround sentence is the best I saw in a Spider-Man movie. But a Spider-Man movie isn't only made of Spider-Man. We have Peter Parker's arc outside the suit as well. And it's excellent. The high school environment looks like a high school environment (the best friend, the bully, the crush, the cynical, everyone is here and they're great characters) and Tom Holland is the most charismatic and trustworthy Peter Parker (as a teenager, he looks and acts like one) and his chemistry with Laura Harrier (Liz) is undeniably cute. Finally, Vulture is an excellent villain: he's imposing, has a motivation that makes sense, and despite not having Spider-Man as a direct enemy, is a person who is next to Peter and had the superhero interfering in his plans. My only issue with this movie is Aunt May, who is constantly treated like a MILF, and that joke is the only one that is repetitive and never works. It's sad because Marisa Tomei is a good actress and has the perfect age-looking for the role.",28-Oct-21,3.5,0.109,0.656,0.235,0.9924,,,,,,

Marco B,"Spider-Man finally gets a full length MCU treatment in this (sort-of) reboot to the franchise. Tom Holland is probably the most accurate portrayal of our young hero, Peter Parker, as he deals with the after math of working with Iron Man's Avengers (see Civil War). Peter is an easy-going fun loving kid who wants the girl, to impress Tony Stark, and to be popular. The positive in this film is that it is a real coming of age tale with a kid trying to deal with being a kid. Even our villain, The Vulture, is excellently played by (my favourite Batman) Michael Keaton, who has less of a plan and is just plain greedy. This film suffered from a lack of consequences as Peter has nothing really to lose, only his potential position in the Avengers, which isn't that big a deal. The other problem with this film is it can't decide whether it's a teen flick, action movie, coming of age tale or an origin story. Because of this, the plot and pacing can be off at times, but the acting makes up for this as Spidey really shines through.",16-Sep-21,4.5,0.058,0.846,0.096,0.7566,,,,,,
Conor P,"My personal/Most rewatchable Spider-Man movie to date. Of course that's not putting down the brilliant Spider-Man 2 from Sam Rami, however this movie is the one I gravitate towards when wanting to put on a Spider-Man film. The Amazing cast really helps push the movie to a higher level with 'Tom Holland' playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man this is the first time I actually believed the actor could actually be in high school whereas former iterations who looked in there mid 20s. Tom Holland to me plays both Spider-Man & Peter brilliantly with Michael Keaton also doing a superb job as the movies villain 'The Vulture' Michael manages to make you feel bad and understand the character one moment then makes you fear him the next, You have to give props to the actor when his powerless character is threatening a superhuman and you are actually worried for the latter. I would 100% recommend this film to any superhero/Spidey fan but I would also recommend this film to casual fans at it is just simply a good & awesome movie.",13-Sep-21,4.5,0.075,0.754,0.171,0.9552,,,,,,

Stephy S,"An action-packed coming of age story full of laughs and engaging fight sequences, Spider-Man Homecoming is a cheesy story that doesn't take itself too seriously but still makes time for heartfelt scenes that show who Peter Parker is as a person. The CGI from Marvel is phenomenal, as to be expected. The plot is your average light hearted Marvel plot and it works about as well as you'd expect, the writing isn't some magnum opus but it's decent enough for it to be forgiven. The cast is however a bit hit or miss, Robert Downey Jr is charismatic and a blast as always and Michael Keaton is insidious and one of the better Marvel villains, but we can't speak about the cast without talking about its rendition of Spider-man aka Peter Parker. Tom Holland is truly fantastic, he's cheesy, he's quippy, he's charming, he's everything you could ever want out of a Spider-Man, and most importantly, he's having fun in the role. Unfortunately, outside of these three, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. The pacing while at times too fast is never terrible. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a solid first attempt for Marvel at a standalone Spider-Man movie that at times just misses the mark.",4-Sep-21,4.5,0.067,0.725,0.208,0.9888,,,,,,

May L,"Spider-Man: Homecoming gives us something that we haven't seen yet in the MCU so far: a youthful perspective, being that of a teenager. This is a breath of fresh air for Marvel fans, especially younger ones, since the overwhelming majority of characters we've been introduced to in the MCU have been adults or older. For a second reboot of the Spider-Man character, this one works incredibly well as it deviates from the formula that the original and first reboot followed. Tom Holland, a familiar face from Civil War, is also a great casting choice for Peter Parker, since he's actually young and gives a great performance as an amateur superhero who wants to get involved in action that's a bit out of his paygrade. Peter's abilities may not be relatable to viewers, but his mindset definitely is: he's dealing with problems that a lot of teenage boys go through, like school and girls, and trying to balance all of that with ""extracurricular"" commitments. This movie, like Civil War, also deals with the consequences of actions which contributes to the realistic and relatable nature of the film, although it does so on an appropriately smaller scale. It's nice to see Tony Stark take a mentor/father figure position with Peter, as in Civil War he was more of a recruiter and it's overall cool to see how Tony and Peter both change each other and progress as characters. Interactions between the two are likely some of the most down to Earth and relatable moments of the entire film. Michael Keaton's Vulture is a unique villain for the film and one of the first times we've seen a villain be motivated by providing for their family and making ends meet, which gives viewers a villain they can sympathize for. Through all this, Homecoming might be the most relatable film in the entire MCU, both to younger viewers who are having these experiences and to older ones who've had them in the past. The only real fault of the movie is a timeline error that occurs right near the beginning which places the movie in a year that it can't take place in. The error isn't egregious but is easily noticeable and slightly disrupts the continuity of the MCU timeline. Spider-Man: Homecoming is not only a nice new direction for movies based on the character but is easy to connect to and I'd strongly recommend it to younger viewers.",22-Jul-21,3.5,0.1,0.778,0.122,0.2583,,,,,,

It's such an energetic and fresh take on the character and the level of polish on top of it all is among the best of Disney's MCU. Using a typically underutilized villain is a brilliant move as a starting point for the Tom Holland Spidey era and Michael Keaton as Vulture is funny, creepy, and truly menacing. What makes Homecoming shine the most though is Peter's setting in high school and his friends. This movie is hilarious and provides comic relief at the perfect moments constantly through Ned, Peter's ""man in the chair."" This is certainly the pinnacle of Spider-Man live action movies to this point and there's more to come.",21-Jun-21,3.5,0.06,0.625,0.315,0.9934,,,,,,
Charlie H,"I hadn't watched any MCU movies until the release of Avengers: Infinity War. Everyone was talking about it and I had just joined college. So I decided to bingewatch all the MCU movies so that I could catch up before AvengersL Endgame releases. As I was watching all the movies I was getting really impatient to watch Spider-Man: Homecoming. The reason is pretty obvious: It's Spider-Man, literally the only superhero I actually cared about before watching MCU. Sure Iron Man came a close second, but I wouldnt' know anything about Iron Man if not for MCU. Spider-Man, however, I was a fan of him since childhood. I had watched the Sam Raimi trilogy, I had played that 2000 game, I had his toys and I had seen his cartoons. So Spider-Man is the only MCU hero who is so close to my heart. And here he has been given a very faithful adaptation. The first thing that makes this movie so interesting for me is how Spider-Man's suit is in the movie. Overall this is the third adaptation of the popular superhero (not counting any bootleg movies). Toby Maguire's Spider-Man has all his superpowers within himself. He shot webs from his veins (I guess?), was immensely strong, could climb walls and had the spidey sense. Then came the Andrew Garfield one. He used a web shooting device for shooting webs, like how it actually happens in the comics (other than the comic book fans no one knew this is actually how Spider-Man shot webs), but other than that everything else came from within him. Tom Holland's Spider-Man, however, neither shot webs from his hands nor could climb walls. He required his suit for the purpose. His suit also did the work of the spidey sense, which made him have to do almost nothing for a fight. This is not just a good way of showing how much he is dependant on the suit (something which is talked about later), but also gives his powers a lot more scope. His web shooters have multiple mods, he has an instant kill mode, GPS, AI that gave him all the information he needed and overall made him pretty much like Tony Stark but with a Spider-Man suit instead of an Iron Man suit. The second thing which made this movie so interesting for me is that it focused on what makes Spider-Man so interesting instead of focusing on the same storyline as the two previous interpretations. We don't have to listen to Uncle Ben's story once again, we don't have to listen to Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy's relations with him, we don't have to know how he learnt of his responsibilities. Rather we jumped right into the good part - how a child is trying to handle his responsibility as an amateur teenage superhero and balancing his school life at the same time. Who can possibly forget that Stan Lee cameo? And finally the third reason why I like this movie so much is because of what is at the stakes. Normally if anyone like me skims through all the MCU movies we'd notice that the movies don't have stakes on a personal level but rather on a global level. Captain America isn't fighting Red Skull because he himself is in danger but rather for his country. Thor fights for his kingdom. Iron Man fights for what he thinks is right. And on the other hand there are those fights which take place due to personal reasons, like Iron Man 3 or Captain America: Civil War. Here, however, both personal and global levels are on threat. Spider-Man has to stop the Vulture so that his city can be safe BUT he can't attack him because he's Mary Jane's father. His morals cause trouble because of which Tony takes back his suit, but later returns it after seeing the good in Peter. These are some small moments that end up humanising a superhero and makes us care about his personal life. I see nowadays it has become something of a trend to bash Tom Holland's Spider-Man, which is mostly because people tend to compare him to Toby Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Among all the reviews sorting by Review Date are mostly critical of this movie. All I'd say to these people is dude, read the comics first. Tom Holland is the most comic accurate depiction of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is an immature kid who is trying to balance his life as a schoolkid and a superhero. He isn't as smart as us and gets those edgy mood swings, so we definitely can't expect him to be another Tony Stark.

Molly M,"Tom Holland makes his first solo debut in the MCU as the New York web-slinger in a film about responsibility and being a teenager. The film is a direct continuation of Captain America: Civil War, where viewers first got to see Holland's portrayal of the titular hero. Following immediately on from Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming follows 15-year-old Peter Parker (Holland) as he finds himself back in Queens, New-York, as he tries to juggle being a teenager with his superhero alter-ego. Fuelled by his recent tussle with the Avengers, Peter eagerly awaits his next mission from his mentor Tony Stark (Downey Jr), but Tony, not wanting to put Peter in danger, keeps him on a tight leash. When the Vulture emerges, Peter takes this as the perfect opportunity to show Stark that he has what it takes to join the Avengers. But in typical Marvel fashion, Peter has bitten off way more than he can chew, soon realising that it's the man inside the suit that makes the hero, not the technology around him. The filmmaking throughout the entire MCU is sensational, and Spider-Man: Homecoming definitely isn't the odd one out. The score, courtesy of Michael Giacchino, is exciting, fierce and adds another level of intensity to the film. Jon Watt's directorial inexperience doesn't show at all through the 133 minutes. It explains why he has been tapped, to not only direct all three Spider-Man films but Marvel's heavily anticipated MCU debut of the Fantastic Four. As well as being visually pleasing, the script is also incredibly well written. The comedy is well-timed and has just the right amount of emotion weaved into it. But something many Marvel fans will notice is where the film introduced Adrian Toomes (Keaton) in 2012. It skips to the present day with a title card saying '8 years later' which, if you've watched 'The Avengers', you'd know it was set in 2012, and Spider-Man: Homecoming' is set in 2016. But this has been confirmed by Joe Russo, co-director of many other Marvel projects, to be a simple, yet confusing mistake. One of the good things about this reiteration of Spider-Man is that viewers don't have to rewatch the entire origin of the hero, bug bite and all. The cinematography and visual aspects of the film are phenomenal. The stylish, colourful aesthetic appeals to viewers of any age and the convincing special effects are a feast for the eyes. Tom Holland does an excellent job in the leading role. His portrayal of Peter Parker is bubbly, buoyant and just how you'd expect a teenager in his position to be. He also does a good job separating the nerdy, awkward teenager from the charming neighbourhood superhero. If you weren't already aware going into the film, you would probably be surprised to discover that Tom Holland isn't from Queens, but Kingston-Upon Thames in London. Jacob Batalon and Zendaya also give great performances, providing comic-relief when needed. Like always, Michael Keaton gives an impressive performance as the menacing villain Vulture, aka Adrian Toomes. Toomes is one of the more humane villains to appear in the MCU. Despite not set on world domination or mass extinction, Toomes does have a somewhat unique motivation, but not individual hatred, for Tony Stark as many past characters have shown. Robert Downey Jr's supporting role in the film wasn't cheap. With a screen time of only 15 minutes, it's reported that he was paid around $15 million, which equivocates to $1 million a minute. But that wasn't a waste as he does a great job portraying the mentor for this young Avenger, and putting Peter in his place when he needs it. The great thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming, is its perspective. For the first time, viewers get to see the MCU from a youth's point of view. A big theme of the film is patience. Peter is so excited at the prospect of becoming an Avenger that he forgets he's only 15 and should probably stay close to the ground for a little longer. It relates to the idea that power coincides with responsibility and vice versa. So if you have this great power, make sure you consider the responsibility that comes with it. But as shown in 'Spider-Man: Far From Home', once you take on that responsibility, it's not just something you can run away from, you have to be consistent and present with it in all aspects. In conclusion, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a film that will appeal to Marvel fans of all ages. It's one of the more upbeat origin stories of the MCU. It shows how Peter matures over the 133 minutes, while still reminding viewers that Peter is still just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man - not some hot-shot super soldier or billionaire playboy.",14-Apr-21,4.5,0.047,0.792,0.161,0.9988,,,,,,

Lariste K,"Whoever gave this corporate chunk of prequel/sequel/reboot/brand extension 92% must REALLY like Rotten Tomatoes, you know what I'm gettin' at?? This movie is more character driven and less disappointing than the failure that was Spiderman 3 from Sam Raimi, or the two not-really-essential remakes under a different, cheaper casting made five years later. (When auds still had the key frames and dialogue from the ""original"" movies crystal fresh in their memory. . .) This film is: funny, sorta zany, a little dangerous and large screen in terms of VFX and action sequences. Only ONE naff/patriotic superhero event is included and the (disposable) villain has legacy vibe for appearing in Tim Burton's WB marketing success Batman in 1989. An issue with this film: Spiderman's (famous) suit is bisected by offputting lines and bits of geometry that are clearly NOT part of the costume, also the ""small eyes"" Spidey mask is either a) a bad decision that looks quite blank and outdated or b) a ""tribute"" to the Steve Ditko era. . . it's obvious if you look at screenshots that the classic Spiderman look in Sam Raimi's first two films are WAY better onscreen than this design.",5-Apr-21,4.5,0.095,0.82,0.084,-0.536,,,,,,
Dean S,"I guess I'm in the minority as I can't stand Tom Holland as Spiderman and his Asian friend. I was never a fan of Tom Holland so seeing him in all of the Avenger movies and Spiderman movies just brings the ratings down for me. I thought this movie was total crap too. I like Zendaya as I'm a huge fan of her on her show Euphoria, but I don't know if she is the right fit for Michelle. The whole story was pretty lame too. I think Zack Snyder's directors cut of Justice League is better than all of the new Spiderman movies combined, so it looks like DC is making a comeback!",3-Apr-21,4.5,0.086,0.699,0.215,0.9557,,,,,,

Darius K,"So we find out that Thor has an elder sister who is the goddess of death and wishes to kill them all if they do not bow down to her. Hella, the hidden sister, is played well by Cate Blanchett. Ragnarok, or end of days, is referred to in this movie as the end of days for Asgard. Of course, Loki, the trickster is alive, making his tearful death in the previous film now irrelevant. And we find Hulk, now on Planet Sakaar hailed to all as the Grand Champion. And the Grand Master is none other than Jeff Goldblum. The only gripe would be with the Valkyrie – an actress of color portraying a Norse character. To put it into perspective, in this current day and age, Norway has less than 2% who are African heritage. So back in the days of yore, the only men and women were white and mostly blonde. How does a black woman attain such an honour? I would really not mind if it had been an actress of acclaim or someone with better acting skills or even someone with a better back story than ""I was almost killed by Hella once so now I commit treason by turning my back on my duty and show young girls it's okay to be stupid drunk all the time, so much in fact that I pass out"". After all, Heimdall was portrayed by Idris Elba who, in my opinion is a class actor, so much that I don't mind a race-swap in James Bond if he plays it. Idris Elba clearly became a fan favorite for not just myself but a whole lot of others. Yet this actress who plays the Valkyrie has no prior street-cred to her name and it remains to be seen if she will become popular with the MCU among fans. Also along lines of diversity, I read that they were trying to make this character bisexual – something that didn't show up in the film and thankfully so. Then we have the great Anthony Hopkins who reprises his role as Odin, perhaps for the last time. That definitely adds a touch of class. And Karl Urban does a great job as Skurge, and to see him who is a survivor, choose to right path even when he knows it will lead to his doom, is sublime. Of course, if you thought that the actors in the Thor/Loki play in the beginning of the movie look familiar, then you are quite right. Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth have cameo roles as Loki and Thor play actors. Yup, Stan Lee also has a role as always, happy to re-design Thor's hairstyle. The movie completely destroys what we now know of Asgard, there is no Odin, no Thor Hammer, no Rainbow Bridge and no Asgard. While the paradigm shift is drastic, its repercussions will only be felt in the later movies of the MCU. All in all, a pretty good movie even though it seems to add a feeling of finality to the rich background of Thor, namely Asgard, his family and Asgardian comrades and friends. The story was tightly written, the action was strong, the humour in between was well-timed and the new supporting cast added depth to the story.",26-Jan-22,5,0.066,0.771,0.164,0.9955,,,,,,

Dark C,"It's a shame that Thor Ragnarok was reduced to ""The adventures of Thor and Hulk in Sakaar"", don't get me wrong, I loved the first part of the movie, but I wanted to see more of Hella and less of Sakaar's fight club. And speaking of Hella I have to say that she was a remarkable villain, so powerful that it took destroying the whole planet to defeat her, that's something! I just wish they explored her story a little more instead of, in the end I feel like Marvel is its own worst ennemy, they decided to center into Hulk in this film because they don't have the rigths to make a Hulk solo movie, so by marketing this one as ""a Thor movie"" they were able to explore what happened with Hulk after Avengers: Age of Ultron, clever move, but it came at the cost of reducing screen time for the rest of the characters of this movie. The soundtrack and visuals of this movie are astonishing, really enjoyed them.

Bradley W,"Thor Ragnarok is a very fun Marvel movie and is easily the best of the three Thor films. It has two good villains that are completely different from each other in Grandmaster and Hela. It brings together the two strongest members of the Avengers, Thor and Hulk, to fight side by side. It is overall a very bright and colorful movie, that looks out of place when put next to the previous two Thor films. It isn't without its issue though as the movie feels like two entirely different films were pieced together, which does lead to some strange tone shifts at times, and both storylines are interesting with the Asguard storyline seeming to suffer due to time constraints. Overall Thor Ragnarok is a very important movie and explains where Hulk and Thor were during the events of Captain America Civil War. I highly recommend going back and watching this movie again, but it can probably be skipped if doing only the essentials of rewatching the Marvel Cinematic Universe in preparation for Endgame.",16-Dec-21,4.5,0.058,0.836,0.107,0.7215,,,,,,

Cailan D,"Thor: Ragnarok is a franchise saver and redeemer after its two predecessors. Seconds in the movie already has a completely different feel from the two that came before it, and this difference is a huge breath of fresh air and makes the movie far more enjoyable than the two that came before it. Hemsworth is at the peak of his comedy, Loki has a great character arc, Hulk is a welcome face and Korg and the Grandmaster are scene-stealers. Hela is a far more powerful, intimidating and convincing villain than Malekith was, and she's a formidable foe to our heroes. Ragnarok perfectly balances comedy with sadness and seriousness and goes a great job of not squandering it's A-list lead and supporting cast as it gives every substantial character moments to shine. There are a few nice callbacks to previous MCU installments, but the thing about this movie that stands out is how entertaining it is considering that the stakes are decently high. Ragnarok is a movie that wants to have as much fun as possible considering its premise, and it succeeds in doing so in every regard. It delivers in every way that fans would want for a third installment, but it also fundamentally changes the Thor franchise and takes both it and the character in new directions that they badly needed. The mid-credits scene nicely and smoothly ties the movie back into the bigger universe and timeline with disrupting the flow of the movie.

Puroo R,"After the release of Infinity War, I had begun bingewatching all the MCU movies. And I'm not gonna lie to you. I wasn't feeling like watching this movie. After seeing Thor and Thor: The Dark World, I had taken the assumption that Thor movies are always bleak and lifeless. They always try to be serious when they can't possibly do it when they have characters like Thor, Loki and Odin. And so when it was time for me to watch this movie I was very reluctant, because I knew I can't skip it. But I'm glad I sat through this movie, because it was a huge improvement. The movie started out in Asgard, from the point where Thor: The Dark World left (and honestly the only thing I remember about that movie). The way that movie had ended, I had thought this movie would build more on Loki pretending to be Odin. But that ended immediately. Instead this movie focuses on Thor and Loki's estranged sister Hela, who had been abandoned by Odin at a young age. She easily manages to defeat both Thor and Loki and sends them to exile on Sakaar, with Thor reaching the planet two weeks after Loki. That was the part where the movie skyrockets the interest. I like everything about it movie from a cinematic point of view - the CGI, the acting, the comic timings, the story, the dialogues. Everything is absolutely perfect. I could undoubtedly say that this is one of, if not the best superhero movies which is not an origin story but rather a continuation of events. The comedy of the arc is the selling point. My favourite dialogue was the rock guy saying, ""I planned to start a revolution but didn't publish enough pamphlets so hardly anyone turned up."" After Thor, Loki, Hulk and Valkyrie come back to Asgard to stop Hela we get the best CGI ever witnessed with Thor. I really like how his eyes glow whenever he has to shoot lightning. I always wanted him to be like that. Thor really had a very drastic character development. I know many people have said this - he lost his father, learnt about his sister, his friends were killed, his precious hair was cut by none other than Stan Lee himself, he continuously got taken down by Valkyrie and lost against Hulk, his entrie planet got blown up and his people encountered Thanos in space. And yet this was the funniest MCU movie yet. And not just Thor, every scene that had Loki in it was always interesting too. However, this movie was obviously not without its set of flaws. For starters the elephant in the room, the amount of exposition that was given throughout the movie was too much, with most of it never being mentioned any time afterwards. There was even a scene where Thor is explained everything about Sakaar on a virtual trip, but it was never talked about afterwards nor was it necessary. If it wasn't for this unnecessary padding of runtime, I'd have given it 5/5. The Planet Hulk arc was also quite unexplored from the comics, and it would have been great if they made a spinoff movie on Hulk also since Hulk has never been given a solo movie starring Mark Ruffalo. Then the biggest plot hole, Valkyrie electrocuting Thor also didn't make sense since Thor is literally the God of Thunder and he shoots lightning from his hands. And then when Hela pins Thor he gets the ex-machina of his father telling him about his superpowers. Thor: Ragnarok is an excellent MCU movie. It's kinda sad that this can't be enjoyed unless you've watched Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Because it could have really been cool to show to someone who has no idea what the MCU is all about. It does have the good reward to it, since you can watch Avengers: Infinity War after it. And the tone of this movie is so flexible that even the grim Infinity War completely suits in being its sequel.",8-May-21,4.5,0.105,0.789,0.105,0.7458,,,,,,
Jerry S,"I really had a lot of fun with this film. This movie was just entertaining throughout. I really love every character in this film.

I love pretty much about every aspect of the story. And the visuals were just drop dead memorably gorgeous. My favorite scene is with Valkyrie and her backstory. It's just the most visually appealing, and it just looks like it's from a painting. The only problem that I have with this movie that it is a bit too much of a good time. This movie is trying too hard to be funny, which it is and it's good. But it does need a few moments just to breathe just a little bit. Not too much, but enough to make us feel more emotion.

Mark B,"MCU #17: The funnest Marvel movie of them all. MY GOD do I love this movie. After two middling Thor movies, Taika Waititi does James Gunn one better and makes Thor: Ragnorak the funniest and funnest MCU movie to-date. Chris Hemsworth seamlessly embodies Thor just as Robert Downey Jr. is as irreplaceable as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Hemsworth is so comfortable in the role you can't imagine anyone else playing the character. And damn if Tessa Thompson isn't the most bad-ass (anti-)heroine of the MCU -- she's like the Han Solo for Marvel. She's just fantastic. If Natalie Portman doesn't bring her A-game to Love and Thunder, (which she didn't to the first two) I'd like to start a petition that Tessa Thompson takes her place (without the horrible Valkyrie outfit). Cate Blanchett rips it as Maleficent (er, I mean Hela). I love the way she just makes Karl Urban her boy-toy. Without her guidance would he really have manned up and jumped out of a space ship double wielding machine guns?!?! The majority of the action and dialogue scenes with Hulk proves the point that the Hulk is SO much better as a supporting character than.

The humor really didn't work at all for me (I think I laughed maybe 3 or 4 times) and it all just felt so out of character for everyone. I really had a hard time ever taking anything seriously because there was a constant barrage of stupid jokes every 30 seconds. The only real positives I can think of were Heimdall, who was very good as usual, and a couple decent moments from Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I did not care for Valkyrie at all, her character really just bothered me truly. All in all, I really struggled to even make it through this whole movie without turning it off. I really wanted to like this movie, having heard almost exclusively positive things about it, but I could not. It isn't even just that it is a humorous movie in the MCU, because I genuinely love both Guardian's of the galaxy movies. It was just a bad movie, in my humble opinion.

If there was anything really going on in this film, I liked the thoughtfulness with which it portrayed the old villains. Molina was great to see again, and the redemption arc was nice. I wish we could have gotten a similar thing with the Sandman, but the thing was overstuffed as it is. The Green Goblin going full Nietzsche and attacking Aunt May's charity as a ""crusade"" was a great idea to set up the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line.

Tom Holland still acts like he’s 12 (which makes him annoying sometimes), the jokes are hit or miss, and the pacing is questionable most of the time. If you’re a big Spider-Man fan, then this movie is for you, but if not, then I wouldn’t get your hopes up.",1-May-22,4.5,0.071,0.687,0.241,0.9763,,,,,,

Noah G,"Great movie until the end… Mr. Peter Parker drives on through another heroes journey… until the end when he fails to learn anything. It has blessedly little technobabble or the dreaded exposition dump & that makes the movie even better. The Director/Writer lets the audience understand the characters through their actions, choices, & dialogue… SPOILERS… … … Marvel Studios needs to either hire me, or someone other than who they have checking basic logic & continuity because they fail hard in this one. Doctor Strange basically casts a hypnotism spell on the whole world, yet that leaves all physical evidence. The world may forget about Peter Parker one day but the next they would check their notes & figure it all out again. To the distortion of mine, M. J. sounds similar to those who typically keep journals… actually most super intelligent people do that… Getting accepted into M. I. T. suggests she is very intelligent, thus she would figure everything out in less than a day. Then she is going to be pissed that Mr. Parker failed her twice over. First, twice he made the selfish choice of getting Dr. Strange to cast a memory wipe spell without consulting her on if she even wants to lose all her memories. His fake buddy Ned… cause he has failed to be treated as a best friend by Mr. Parker… Both EDITH, the drones, & their programing are also physical instead of mental. Thus, Peter would continue to have access to Stark tech. It is obvious the writers/directors wanted to take Mr. Parker back to barely having a social footprint on society. Yet they obviously think fans are stupid, or their not going to see the problem he still faces. Even EDITH is rather silly. It seems Tony Stark would trust the future to not have major problems in the event of his biological death. Spiderman: Homecoming should have made it clear to him that trusting Mr. Parker to act like an adult was a mistake... One Doctor Strange repeated. Neither would Mr. Stark trust the governments or any other governmental organizations that fashion themselves as having authority. Therefore, it seems more likely he would create a underground mechanical automated city to be run by either FRIDAY or a digitized version of himself. S. W. O. R. D. proved to all that expectation of abuse from those claiming authority is right. More over, that leads to him insuring his technology would be kept out of the hands of such authoritative organizations claiming ""national security"" & other such nonsense. All Mr. Peter Parker needs is the impetus, call to action, initial rejection of call to action, a fundamental character flaw he works through as the story progresses. Trying to literally put him back into the poor house is a pointless mistake. Pointless, because there are many other ways to achieve the same objective. Mistake, because character progression is fundamentally erased by everything that happened in the prior two movies. His character is defined by the friends he keeps. & the whole trope of pushing a loved one away to 'protect' them is a a tired old trope that is monumentally annoying to the distortion of mine. For Gravity being shared by you, grateful am I. May the Goddess be asked to alighten a path towards love, joy , & happiness along the self'determined life'cycle chosen by the higher'self of yours by you, pray do I.",1-May-22,4.5,0.129,0.72,0.151,0.9474,,,,,,

Markku T,"The genre of superhero movies is not dead, even if Disney has been doing their all to ruin it with woke politics. Fortunately Sony has come to rescue with this sublime blend of nostalgic characters and exploration of central Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility. Transcending history and the world, a tale of souls and spiders, eternally retold, this time in triplicate. What a wild ride! Character motivations were laid out in great depth with simple strokes, which made the battles so much more interesting; each villain had understandable, rational goals, and they were fighting for their lives for once instead of merely power, madness, or destruction of Spider-Man. Benedict Cumberpatch really nails Dr. Strange (once again), and the impudent humor strikes a great tone for the events. I have always had a soft spot for Doc Ock (since 1980 when I started reading Spider-Man comics), and it was such a treat to see Molina retread the role with great aplomb. Willem Dafoe was again an incredible Norman Osborne and Green Goblin: I've always had such a burning hatred for the character, and he did not defuse it at all, since his madness still ruins everything he touches. His fate simply underscored Peter Parker's ability for forgiveness, even if it were unearned and given at such great cost. Venom is such waste of space that the end clip did not do anything to me.

Astrid G,"Today I'm going to talk about Marvel's latest effort, the latest film from the MCU Spiderman: No Way Home, for the direction of John Watts. This film was a mediatic phenomenon, as we all know, there were high expectations and have been made a lot of assumptions by Marvel fans and not only. I think this hype is good for cinema in general but a terrible film like this isn't worth for all this hype, the others lose something because everyone have been to the cinema only for a film that I don't feel like call as such. The direction seems not to exist and unfortunately, I'm not kidding, everything is made by the computer and you don't understand anything. There isn't photography or cinematography, anything, not even a shot that you could remind, nothing remains in mind except the thought about the money you have spent for buying a ticket and watching this total idiocy. The previable plot has a lot of plot twist that do not add anything to the plot which is predictable, like the 90% of the events, so the story is a total idiocy. It seems like the people who written this film, which is not a real film, did not have any ideas and invented a mess for end in something obvious. The concept in the beginning is useless, so if I want to remove what is useless this film would last for like 15 mins. The screenwriting isn't decent, to add, with a lot of mandatory rules broken with narrative elements that are equal to all and not innovative, and all this fix me a question in mind: How did they write this film? The principal character are: Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and the ones from the old Spiderman's films. Tom Holland's Spiderman isn't interesting because is like a dumb boy with stupid ideas that don't make sense, he wants to be a hero but he is incapable, it comes out badly. He is kid that acts in an unwatchable way, in fact he has two expressions; one when he's happy and the other one when he is sad, when he cries, he is ridicules and not credible. In conclusion his acting was cringe. Moreover, this Doctor Strange of Benedict Cumberbatch is like a child in fact he has behaviors truly questionable; he is stupid and the symbol of the terrible fanservice, he made thing that the old Doctor Strange would never do, he can't even do spells in the right way, c'mon. So, for resume everything in one word, he is an idiot. Thanks, this film, they demonstrated that the actors of the Sam Raimi's trilogy are the best, because they are such great actors and they work perfectly, from fantastic William Dafoe's Goblin to wonderful Otto Octavius of Alfred Molina. When I think that I spent my time in 2 hours and 30 min of vision, which are super long, for this terrible film, I feel sick, I wasted my time and everyone who watched it, because there isn't something new, it isn't cinema, only a product of marketing, only for sell tickets and so and so forth. Having seen this film, I'm really scared for upcoming new MCU movies, if this is the type there will be in the future I recommend Marvel to do a pleasure for itself and everyone else and close the doors and say goodbye to everyone. In conclusion, with all the hype there was for this terrible film, they could done it better, and it didn't take much in hindsight. They must not have the objective of satisfying the fans but only do something new that could be called entertainment and not repugnance in the vision, something that could not be called only fanservice but also cinema.",25-Apr-22,1,0.142,0.723,0.135,-0.3635,,,,,,

Ostin r,"The film is far from the best examples of Marvel. The plot is quite primitive, and if desired, any pimply teenager can find holes in it. Seriously. Why did not everyone transfer to the new world? And if that's all, then why didn't the Green Goblin think of such a simple mechanism as blackmailing the first spider with his MJ? Where have the other superheroes gone? Why is the Statue of Liberty crumbling to dust in downtown New York, and the Avengers and X-Men don't care? Where are Strange's colleagues? In addition, Marvel was again poured into moralizing. Any villain can now be fixed by injecting (or exploding in front of his nose) a serum of unknown origin. Where was she before? And why didn't they know about her in the wars with Thanos? Or is Peter Parker smarter than Stark? Any evil can be made good - this is the sermon with the zeal of the American Founding Fathers in this Marvel movie. Works only for the youngest viewers. And even then, not at all The idea of a multiverse is a really good attempt to include everything that came before in the MCU. And here the studio clearly conceived an elegant move, abandoning the semantic overload. Plus, it's a great wiggle room for future films. So you can shoot before collabs with DC or Star Wars. Batman vs Captain America. Luke Skywalker vs Star-Lord. Cashier guaranteed. And the new Spider-Man just raped the nostalgia trend. And this is a very true step. The first wave of movie comics fans have already grown up, have their own children. And here's a thing for you, where dads can cut themselves in serious cabbage soup in a dispute with their kids, whose spider-man is cooler. Marvel is building a cool generational dialogue. Brings forgotten memes to life (are you a bit of a scientist, too?) and makes going to the movies even more of a family affair. That being said, I don't understand the hysteria in the movie. The movie is clearly not to be praised. Cumberbatch is damn good in a cape, Zendaya is a great actress and Holland is a reflection of a new generation. Which of these didn't we know before the movie? In general, the new Spider-Man is a rather clumsy attempt at the New Year's table to retell in your own words the anecdote of a beloved but deceased grandmother that seemed ridiculous. When at the end you realize that he was funny precisely because of the charisma of the departed old woman. And after the retelling, you will find the occasional laughter of some kind of arrogance and the awkward silence of everyone else. Fanfiction is purely for the fanbase.

It was great to see all three Spiderman from the 1st series (in a different Universe) and Spiderman from the second series, thrown in to help Spiderman in our Universe. So, I am going to rate this movie *4* out of 5 stars!!!! P. S. What would have made this movie great is that the kid that had magic, I thought he would have been taken by Dr. Strange as a disciple.",17-Apr-22,3.5,0.033,0.793,0.174,0.9723,,,,,,
Ed I,Once again an overrated collection of tripe that ruins the legacy Spider-Man. How this Tom Holland scrap version of Spider-Man man is popular is beyond me. There is no way in hell that Peter Parker would be an idiot stooge of Tony Stark. The appeal of the character is Peter's hyper intelligence and ingenuity while being socially awkward.

Movie Fan A,"Although it was nice to watch a Marvel movie which is not just a rehash of the same old universe and which was reasonably woke-free for once this movie was unfortunately pretty meh. It is not as bad as many of the detractors claim but it is miles away from being as good as some of those who liked it claims. It is actually pretty meh. On the good side there are some decent special effects but that is more or less to be expected. It is the one thing that Marvel movies usually have going for them after all. It is a fairly serious movie that is not so polluted with comic relief as some of the Marvel movies. The story is a interesting one but it is unfortunately a bit wasted by the implementation in this movie. Also, it pretty much screws up evolution from the extinction of the dinosaurs as well as any form of religious theories (not that I am a great believer in those though). But then this is pure superhero fantasy so I'm not too bothered by that. My main gripe with this movie is that it, as is way to often the case with Hollywood, portrays the Eternals more like a bunch of bickering dysfunctional children than the wise thousands of years old beings that they are supposed to be. Ikarus in particular is a pure Hollywood asshat. He reminds me of that pervert asshole Homelander in the depraved Hollywood creation The Boys. However Druig and Sprite also grated on me in a lot of the scenes. I never like characters that betray people, stick knifes in peoples backs (literally) and so on. The movie also felt a bit slow. There was a lot of rather boring filler material between the actual action or advancement of the story, and a shitload of flashbacks. I hate flashbacks but then that is probably personal. To me they just interrupt the flow. The movie also does not really feel very positive. It ends rather sadly actually. Also, at the end they may have saved Earth but, if the story is to believed, by doing so they prevented billions and billions of beings from ever being created. Not really a win-win is it? It is clear that this movie was setting things up for a continuation and, despite my reservations about this one, I think there is a pretty good oportunity to create something decent from this.

The enemies they face are a bunch of monsters that could've been taken from many other movies. They don't speak either. What happened to character development? The movie felt rushed to me. That it had just been cobbled together without any real effort to make it work well. The casting was wrong. The effects weren't up to the usual Marvel standard.

Annabell M,"I love the MCU, but this movie was really disappointing. When I go to a Marvel movie I'm there for the characters above all else so I was disappointed in the shallow characters and lack of character development in this movie. Marvel usually creates deep, complex characters for the audience to fall in love with but the large cast and long timeline of this movie limited the amount of time that got to spend with each character. As a result, none of the characters got the amount of attention needed to make them compelling. In addition, the plot was poorly constructed and incredibly lacking in suspense. Marvel needs to stop putting such large threats into minor movies. Perhaps this plot could have worked for an Avengers' movie or if there had been a bit of foreshadowing in other movies but it was obvious that Marvel wasn't going to destroy the entire earth and all of humanity in a smaller film like this. The one thing that I really enjoyed in this movie was the beauty of it.

The acting is alright, though there were a few moments where it lacked. The action was great, the CGI was spectacular to look at, and the worldbuilding leaves you hungry for more. My main issue is how convoluted the story is, where it tries to shove everything it possible can with the shortish runtime down the throat of its viewer. The second act is also the weakest and does get a bit boring at parts. However, ""Eternals"" beautifully introduces this new team of heroes into the MCU and perfectly sets up the future for many potential sequels, even if the cost is an otherwise vague and tiring story.",5-Apr-22,0.5,0.055,0.732,0.212,0.979,,,,,,

Nathan G,"On behalf of moviegoers everywhere, please stop making generic movies so long. Nobody wants to budget two and a half hours for B-rate Marvel properties. I haven't been too jazzed about what the MCU has had to offer recently; Shang-Chi fell prey to basically every comic book movie stereotype, but at least it was active and fun, where Eternals is just kind of a slog. The down side of running through all your most recognizable characters and upping the ante to galactic proportions is that there isn't really much further to go, but somehow we need to keep introducing new characters (ten of them this time, each with their own line of action figures coming to a toy store near you) along with reasons why they weren't in the preceding ensemble flicks. Our group cast seems like a checklist of attributes rather than actual characters (it's diverse and that's nice, but most of them are just one defining feature), and there are too many of them to care about any one. The film looks good enough, but the story is middling without enough to latch onto; it's original territory for the MCU, but not necessarily exciting or high-quality. Plus, the film doesn't really have an ending, just a setup for the next film in the series. Yes, Benedict Wong and Don Lee are different people. And at this rate both of them are going to have better film careers than anyone involved in Game of Thrones. (2/5)",2-Apr-22,4,0.025,0.845,0.13,0.984,,,,,,

Phil S,"As a writer who must trust his instincts about a film, I went into viewing this picture on Disney+ with the hope of having an experience that would leave me uplifted. To my dismay, those instinctual voices informed me, about halfway through the film – that this was not going to be the case. In one sequence, in particular, on board the Eternal's mothership The Domo, during Thena's battles, the voice of those subconscious instincts would not stop hammering home the point that this movie should have been titled, ‘The Immortal Nature of Lies and Betrayal'. It is tough living forever (at 66, I feel I can speak – SOMEWHAT, to this dilemma), and it will be even tougher for this franchise to continue to trudge down the path that it has chosen in the face of declining enthusiasm for the genre. This project was the post-Avengers break-out franchise for Marvel Studios, so it needed new blood. Their choice of director was a calculated, wise, and theoretically correct one on the studio's part, knowing all the while they were going to hamstring this fresh new Academy Award-winning auteur. It is sad to see the sprigs of a budding artist's blooms wither in the chill of an early Spring frost. Marvel has a history of doing this sort of thing; hiring bright minds with vision, only to constrain that vision with production schedules, budget limitations, and dumbed-down script rewrites. But once again the industry Goliath, Disney, has achieved success in the realm of mediocrity for the bigger bottom line. It is a sadly gilded cage of a movie, all glitz, and glamour on the outside, whereupon opening the cage door, we find a couple of inactive, dour parakeets. The movie's interiority is missing or has been replaced with what the studio wanted to achieve at its box office – meaning, money, and the love thereof, almost guaranteeing the sacrificing of the beautiful songbirds. This COULD have been a more breath-taking Eternals' origin story had they not clipped its wings by not offering us a more panoramic view of the director's vision. Their streaming platform would have been the appropriate canvas for this artwork. I loved the all-encompassing expanses of the establishing shots, and settings, and applaud the leniency that allowed its artist to go to those locations in order to establish story authenticity. But once again, Disney doesn't want to make us uncomfortable with variations in plot structure or place us in terrain where our footing is unsure. So, we are served the same placating comedic quips and dialogue that will ensure our comfort zones are not infringed upon. They have served us with a portion of diversity that lacks divergence. The characters range in age, gender, race, and sexuality, even in deafness, but without the fire and true conflict that diversity has the potential to generate. The first Marvel gay kiss lacks any passion at all. OK, so they didn't want to showcase the passion inherent in a gay relationship (the movie was even banned in the countries represented by the actor's ethnicity), nor the fact that the real spice in any sex scene, like the one on the beach, happens BELOW the belt. C'mon man, this first-time love scene for Marvel, was more akin to the dying fish left gasping for air, as the tide strands them than the impassioned writhing of two super-powered beings! But this is how a commitment to the bottom line, in large corporate systems, ensures that a work of art, which is very subjective depending on its audience, will be a financial success: flatten its curves, deaden its vibrant contrasts, hence broadening its horizons. It is the Marvel formula; in order to guarantee the monetary longevity of a franchise, it tends not to confuse, offend, or challenge the Marvel fan base, which by now totals in revenues worth killing over – and kill they do. It is the age of ‘Superhero Burn-out', and the tired tropes are wearing thin. We're not going to continue to buy into the formula if this genre doesn't break out into some form of evocative theater down the road. Which, to my estimation, reached epoch velocity with Black Panther, having pierced the cultural ceiling in volcanological proportion. From there, the continuance of predictability and realms of the formulaic gently slopes downward leading us to the foot of the eruptive mountain again. The window dressing is all very nice, but how long do you think we are going to spend our dwindling dollars at a store with last-generation consumables? The story scale alone of the picture, spanning from 5,000 B.C., is the widest historic scale of a Marvel movie yet and requires a strong application of storytelling coupled with terse cinema graphic juxtapositions. Then on top of that, you are supposedly fleshing out the lives of 10 characters. Oh, we get the one-second, two seconds, and three seconds shots alright, continuously – the former?! Not so much… They obviously, bit off more than they could chew at a mere 157-minute movie. It would have played BETTER through the elongated story arches of their six-episodic, streaming model. Given more time, at the same cost for Disney, the timeline alone should have garnered more plumage filling out the expansive beauty of the work via this platform. The studio chose the right Director though, as evidenced by her Academy Award-winning work in Nomadland, but in the wrong venue. This was probably ‘executive thinking', that the compact, more explosive capsule(and in this case – more convoluted format), would produce greater financial returns for their $200 million investment. Then they shackled the artist with studio production standards, taking the breath out of all its exposition. One of the characteristics of all Chloé Zhao's work, is an intimate telling by the characters themselves, painting their personal realities by the way they interact with the environments they find themselves captured in, or possibly held prisoner to. This is not so with these Eternals, they walk through the scenes with what appears to be a bored, empathy, and a dash of subtle entitlement, as if the movie were mocking its own creation. The biggest conflict seeming to arise in their midst is whether to stay loyal to the god who created them and their mission or betray him because he lied to them about who they are. They, then, turn to defend the ones they have fought to serve and protect all along. I think it ironic that the director finds herself in this very same predicament: true to her art or the studio? I question; if she'd not taken their offer – would the film have existed? Or the better question; would we be better off?! It is a sad indictment of the industry that every budding director wants a shot at a Marvel blockbuster, whether it fits their style of movie-making or not. …and therein lies the rub. Money has a way of doing that to every industry eventually – look at today's American politics. Hollywood, especially, is certainly not immune, Babylon, for starters was mockingly an appropriate choice when torquing through the historic establishing shots. I bet when Feige put the handcuffs on Chloe' artistic wrists she slumped, knowing her vision would be adulterated. All in all, Eternals is not Earth-shattering new ground for Marvel. They've created a gorgeous playground and peopled it with mannequins. Not much happening here that you haven't already experienced in a Marvel movie.

Cinematography: What cinematography? Beyond bland. Rote, no imagination. No creativity. Fight scenes: I didn't care. And that is the problem. I just. Didn't. CARE. I don't know how many times this needs to be said, but a few disjointed flashback scenes do NOT equal characterization!! O vey. Why does this seem to be a trend?

Let's forget about the fact that I actually went to the theatre to watch James Bond, but ended up watching this due to a filled theatre, i digress. The Eternals isn't like any other Marvel movies, it has to introduce us to its relatively new characters to an audience that isn't so familiar with its comic book, this already huge task isn't helped by the sheer amount of unnecessary characters it introduces. It is bloated with many characters, just for the purpose of trying to have as many people relate with the diverse cast. It's story telling is even worse, it undoes any progress it developed with it's character in the end, and it also has to justify the characters not interfering with Thanos, it develops a main villain who is supposedly meant to be ominous and feared, only to have him get killed by one of the side characters in a matter of minutes, it also doesn't have a focused story line and hopes we will get over it because of the diversity and the famous characters it introduces. In short the movie is a mess, to me it is the pinnacle of directors trying to add diversity and equity without developing the characters, and even then the movie had a lot of space to make the story line good enough, which it didn't do.

Etai A,"I don't usually find myself disliking marvel movies, but I think I can definitely pinpoint what went wrong with this one. First off, I'd say the worst decision made for this movie was, well, it being a movie. 10 superheroes is a lot. That's more superheroes than the first avengers movie! And while The Avengers had 4 years of movies going into it, this movie takes place in completely unexplored, never mentioned before ground. If they were even mentioned before, or had a TV show with even as many episodes as there are characters plus a few, kind of like What If...?, They would have had way more time to develop characters. Imagine if What If...? released as a movie of all the characters being recruited with brief exposition for each character. Doesn't sound too good, does it? That and some absolutely pointless plot points like Sprite betraying everyone else only to be immediately forgiven by Sersi, like, it's not like they needed here for it to seem like Ikaris had a good chance at all the others, just made a movie that doesn't work.

Each sequel movie could've followed ONE character in a different age, the rise and fall of ancient Mesopotamia, the era of Sultans in India, the Incans in Mesoamerica, England and America in the colonial period, The age of Ghengis Khan, etc, etc, etc. It would've been awesome. A visual world history lesson and action hero movie with every sequel. Instead there were too many characters and too much history to stumble through, confusing pacing and a reveal that should've been a massive start to the final movie in a series. I paused this movie, got up and left the room to do something at least three times because it couldn't hold my attention with all of it's disconnected jumping around. I never do that. Ah well.

The stunts, action, combat, comedy, etc are awesome and so is the acting. The only dislike I have for this movie is that it feels so long. Venom: Let There Be Carnage felt so quick and I am aware that Shang-Chi is longer. The only good side I felt about the feeling of how long this movie is that I did not feel like leaving the theatre.

Also Tony leung as the Mandarin was amazing, and is easily one of the top 5 MCU villains. The character even though you know he's wrong you understand his motivations and sympathize with him, which is in part due to great writing, but also hugely dependent on the actor to bring that to life which Tony did a fantastic job with. It was really nice to be able to dive into the more mystical aspects of the MCU as well as well as some Chinese mythology instead of the usual European based mythology.

Tawan S,"This is the most middle-of-the-road movie I've ever seen. For each thing this movie does well, it does another poorly. For each thing this movie does amazingly, there's a flop to match it. First off is the good: the characters in this movie are very likable. Each one feels understandable and relatable to a degree. All the characters have strengths and weaknesses to overcome. There aren't any Captain Marvel type characters who have no weaknesses. Even the villain of this story feels relatable and understandable. I could sympathize with his reasons for doing what he does. The combat in this movie is fantastic. I loved watching the fight scenes in this movie. If you're into that, you're going to have a fun time. The story is fresh and interesting. I'm pretty unfamiliar with Chinese culture and traditions, and I enjoyed seeing how this was incorporated into the movie. It doesn't feel heavy-handed or preachy. Now for the bad: the dialogue is trash. So many of the lines are laughably bad. The beginning of this movie is the worst offender. So many of the lines feel like they were written by a robot who is trying to prove they aren't a robot. The CGI is so bad in some areas. Clearly, the CGI budget went to the big fight in the end, but the bus scene at the beginning looks so fake. I understand Disney knew this wasn't going to be a $1 billion+ box office movie, so they had to save money, but it looked amateurish in some areas. For a movie belonging to a franchise that's been around for almost 14 years, it could have been a lot better. Finally, the connections to the larger MCU as a whole felt a little weird. There's some mention to the snap and Iron Man, and there's a larger connection to Dr. Strange, but I had so many questions about how this connected to the universe. Why weren't the 10 rings used against Thanos? Did the Avengers not know he existed? You'd think someone would have known this man with immortality exists somewhere. Where was he? It felt like there was a lot of oversight in this department. Marvel, if you want me to care about your new additions in a post-Endgame MCU, you're going to have to do a lot better than that.",10-Apr-22,1,0.083,0.805,0.112,0.9162,,,,,,

Kakos S,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a good film and I'm glad I watched it. But is it good enough for me to recommend you go to the cinema and risk contracting a deadly virus during a pandemic? No, not really. But then again, what is? Let me start by saying that this film's cast is remarkable. Not just because it's an Asian American all-star cast in Hollywood blockbuster but also because there's not a single bad performance among them. Our duo leads, Shaun, aka. Shang-Chi, (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina), have a delightful chemistry between them from the moment we step into their San Francisco lives, though the limelight is quickly snatched by Shaun's sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) who instantly became my favourite among our main characters. Shaun is a likeable lead but his story also suffers from being very formulaic. His mother is dead, his mourning father trained him to be a deadly weapon, he thought he could escape his father's ambitions but now he must face and overcome them. It's stuff we've seen and heard before and while it's stuff that works, it keeps Shang-Chi from truly establishing much of a unique identity. The same goes for the film's antagonist, Shaun's father Wenwu (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) who in typical Marvel fashion is slowly turned from an interesting character with depth to his actions to the typical evil super villain once we reach the final act - though he still manages to have a strong presence throughout the film's 2 hour runtime. As for the story itself, I'm not the right person to say how well it portrays the various aspects of Chinese mythology, but nothing struck me as particularly different from what I have come to expect from American productions with a Chinese motif. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as I'm quite fond of the mythological aspects depicted in Shang-Chi, but it does prevent it from standing out in that regard. However, where the film does stand out is during its action set-pieces. There's a natural flow to the fight scenes that is often missing in other superhero films which I believe can be attributed in great part to the work of stunt coordinator Brad Allan and the (sadly unnamed) Chinese choreographers that director Destin Daniel Cretton reportedly brought on to deliver on the film's wuxia-inspired combat sequences. In particular, there's a fight scene early in the film that takes place on a moving bus which really stood out for me because of how great it looked and felt despite it technically being smaller than most other superhero battles we've come to expect. Though sadly, even this aspect of Shang-Chi succumbs to formula by the final act where the action devolves into a computer-generated effects soup - and not the fun and exciting kind. I realize that I sound very down on this film, but it's only because Shang-Chi's strengths are so strong that the moments of weakness or blandness disappoint me greatly. I do believe it's a really charming film with a lot of heart and glorious performances. It's fast, full of fun action and serves as a landmark achievement for bringing Asian Americans into focus within the world's biggest movie franchise. It just doesn't quite stick the landing, and that's a shame, because when it's in the air it's soaring.",6-Apr-22,1,0.113,0.718,0.169,0.9903,,,,,,

Patricia O,"A good but derivative origin story. After the massive success of Black Panther, it would make sense that Marvel Studios would want to copy elements in other films, but Shang-Chi often feels like a complete ripoff of Black Panther.

Kyle M,"Ever since ""Iron Man"" soared the screen and ignited the Marvel Cinematic Universe, expectations have most of the time been exceeded towards unfamiliar narratives carrying the brand with no need of prerequisite readings from the vast of endless lore touching bases on expansive aspects through different possibilities. Occasionally compels to turn it around by going to the original source materials for background knowledge prior to the coming cinematic chapters – aside from engaging with previous media platforms. But mostly, it is all about being introduced to this continuous worldbuilding pattern of differential storytelling in an ongoing thread that tends to non-drastically remodify the still honored roots. Not only stories that freshens up the comics and experiments across different genres but also accompanied by breakthrough talents whilst welcoming various takes on the generic formula, sometimes culturally molded. Making his debut for the first time from the pages, the latest, and most compelling, Avenger Shang-Chi finally receives a spotlight. His characterized specialty is martial arts, trained by his ancient father Wenwu, to be stronger as an assassin. Once peacefully raised till tragedy struck, Shang-Chi furthered his estrangement to start anew. His actual journey begins when he must confront his buried past with the mysterious Ten Rings, which could unleash his true potential and heal his pain that distanced him from those he recognizably cared. Shang-Chi's creation stemmed from the 70s' fascination with the martial arts genre that eventually received a modern refresh of definitive captivation couple decades later. His unexpected entry into the cinematic roster is part of the interconnected franchise's next phase with a widened horizon of stories to tell in different platforms, mainly prompted in continuing old strings that can either be concluded or lead into another worthwhile story, as part of new beginnings. The Ten Rings were introduced through the Iron Man trilogy, and they finally resurfaced with the true leader's actual motives and hereditary, playing out in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" as the groundbreaking pattern continues. The film starts rather interesting as it imprints its originated Chinese roots with an opening akin to a foreign film. It only lasts till we meet up in the present day, but the impression at the point provides an interesting fashion that could have gone throughout to certify an MCU chapter as a subtitled foreign film. If Marvel is branching across cinematic benchmarks with experimental prompts of signified genres, this would have been a great way to welcome their audience to a foreign experience so it could be culturally thorough via assimilation. However, as interesting that sounds with potential uplift to further solidify its given rating, realistically speaking depends on the nationality story-wise surrounded by characters with preferred language barriers. As for us, we are generally able to connect and understand with the characters domestically easier, thus building up nuanced performances peaked humanely. It stuns as Marvel's own martial arts storytelling with amazing stunt-fuel choreographed action part of the mesmerizing cultural exploration. Even though accompanied or built by visual effects, the practicality behind the movements by the actors remains as the main aura, hence why Shang-Chi is the most compelling Avenger as he was naturally trained with no boosters from science nor weaponry. Not only that but director Deston Daniel Cretton, taking a [proper] step forward towards mainstream heights, made sure to tune the focus of presenting the stunts as more towards dynamical and personal storytelling. This is a closer direction between domestic and foreign arts in channeling the rightfully meaningful aura of these stunts that were performed beautifully in a grace, amplified by Cretton's frequent collaborator Joel P. West's unforgettable, appropriately channeling score. Akin to ""Crazy Rich Asians"", the film mostly stars an Asian ensemble cast that embraces the story's roots and acts as guidance to experienced traditional customs that are presented. Out of all of them, Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh, with Ben Kingsley as their pleasant guest for thankful completeness, are familiar talents with comedic charm and heart, respectively. Awkwafina always can be relied on to provide comedy as she portrays Katy, Shang-Chi's best friend who sticks by his side without knowing his past till now while procrastinating in life by enjoying it. Yeoh, who previously co-starred with Awkwafina (and Ronny Chieng in a minor role) in the aforementioned film, is backed up by an impressive resume that qualifies her as this MCU chapter's own specialized veteran as the genre's most experienced who adds grace to the artistic core. She portrays Ying Nan who guards a scared village. Although, joining her rank is Yeuh Wah who appeared in more credited filmography through supporting roles ranging from minimal to stunts to choreography. As we already have met those stars – and certain few others unnamed, the others such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen actually make up the story's dysfunctional family dynamic as the narrative core aside from the circumstantial action. They add into the perfect casting with exceptional charisma, but more importantly humanely nuanced which is rarely subtly emphasized in these films. This been more observed through Zhang as Shang-Chi's estranged little sister Xialing who trained and built herself away from her father's tyrannical shadow, embodying the positional dynamic from her perspective. Leung portrays the father Wenwu, an original composite as the real ""Mandarin"" and Fu Manchu, who leads the organization named after his mystical possessions he obtained centuries ago while his thirst for power and wonder halted then resumed through grief. He may be typically written as the story's antagonistic force, but Leung turned the character as his own as the most humane ""villain"" trying to bring his family back together by being misled towards an unspoken danger. Fala Chen's character Ying Li was the family's late glue who nurtures and protects as well complete Wenwu's humanity before he decidedly let his guard down in a once peaceful time. Finally, Liu, like his titular protagonist, also makes his mainstream debut with capable skills and life relatability till he must be more headstrong and welcoming to the unnatural family reunion's tested confrontation that could deliver his inherited destiny alongside hopeful reconciliations. His performance in bringing Shang-Chi dimensionally to life is enough to define the character as his own like how Robert Downey Jr. regenerated Iron Man followed by the OG Avengers cast independently building their characters as their own, therefore becoming them in an embrace with eased preparation. ""Black Widow"" is a midquel. ""Captain Marvel"" is the MCU's previous solo venture with a foreseen lead. While interconnected but mainly still self-contained, ""Black Panther"" is a solo ride that continues the formula that ""Doctor Strange"" threw back to ""Iron Man"". Between the cultural roots and nuanced performances as the story's main elements, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a triumphant return to form via agreeably familiar formula that still proves ever entertaining with enough value to sway into the MCU's top ten, starring a new worthy Avenger to look forward to in the coming chapter as part of a new era.

Neil B,"Right from the start, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is reminiscent of old Chinese cinema in a good way. It truly feels like the perfect blend of the heart found in Asian-style movies combined with the action of a Marvel film. Over the course of its first two weekends, the film has gone on to break multiple records such as having the highest rating among comic book films by audiences on Rotten Tomatoes at 98% and shattering previous American box office records for Labor Day Weekend by earning $94.4 million. Also noteworthy is the $18.9 million earned on Labor Day, making it the best Monday for a film during the pandemic and the 28th biggest Monday of all time for any film. Storytelling-wise one of the first things you'll notice is that the pacing is slower compared to the average superhero film which tends to be more action-packed. However, by taking it slow, the film comes across much more intentional and meaningful adding to the emotional journey that Shang-Chi goes through. Tony Leung stole the spotlight with his role as Wenwu. Just like with Killmonger, this was a complex villain filled with both heart and pain. His grief made his place as a villain in the movie all the more meaningful. The fight sequences are something else in Shang-Chi and are unlike what's been seen in other Marvel films. Each strike is art in motion, not just hard fighting skills but also fluid movements. There's a good range of character interactions that touch on the Asian-American/immigrant experience that people I know as well as myself will relate to. This includes having two names, mispronounced names, sexist beliefs from our elders, reconciling personal choices with family/cultural values, and trying to live out your own life while your family has different expectations. Just as varied are the characters and settings in the film. Simu Liu's Shang-Chi moved to America as a teenager and his best friend Katy (played by Awkwafina) is American-born, reflecting the contrast of lives Asian-Americans can have based on when they or their families came to America. The plot of the film takes our protagonists around the world from a familiar San Francisco to the nightlife of Macau to a mystic village named Ta Lo. Each of these different places can remind viewers of different homes that their families may have had, whether it's a modern setting, more affluent, or centered in the countryside. Ultimately, Shang-Chi is the type of movie I wished was available when I was growing up to recognize that my experiences were a shared phenomenon and that there's a place for me and people like me. But I'm glad it is here now and for younger generations.",20-Feb-22,4,0.03,0.861,0.109,0.9885,,,,,,

Matthew D,"Fantastic kung fu action with heartfelt characters in one of Marvel's best movies! Director Destin Daniel Cretton's superhero fantasy adventure Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) really blew me away. I loved Cretton's previous films with his tear-inducing indie drama Short Term 12 and thoughtful prison drama Just Mercy, but Shang-Chi is very ambitious and entertaining. Producer Kevin Feige was smart to get an indie visionary director like Destin Daniel Cretton. Cretton's sterling direction and personal insistence on using actual Chinese dialogue, practical hand to hand combat, and his Asian representation in his fabulous cast is all wonderful. Writers Destin Daniel Cretton, Dave Callaham, and Andrew Lanham create earnest likable heroes with a fascinating villain with an intriguing motivation. Their quaint Marvel jokes work so well with Awkwafina's blunt, casual delivery. I was really enthralled by Shang-Chi's story as his world of kung fu and magical fantasy felt so real and fleshed out. I'm absolutely excited for a sequel now. I enjoyed the crazy Tai Chi style of kung fu throughout Shang-Chi with action choreography from the late Brad Allan. Each fight is impressive and cool with a variety of fighting techniques meshed well with the incredibly realistic looking CGI for the Ten Rings' magic. Cretton's direction focuses on his epic odyssey with pleasant humor and inspired action. I love how Cretton directs and imagines his fantasy world of creatures and magical abilities perfectly blended in with Marvel's superhero style. Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is as compelling as Scott Derrickson for Doctor Strange or Ryan Coogler for Black Panther. Simu Liu is super likable, natural, and endearing as the charming and cool Xu Shang-Chi. He's funny and serious simultaneously and looks effortless for his fearsome fights. Liu really seems like he trained to be ultra fit and convincing as a kung fu master without even needing to use his Ten Rings until the exciting finale. I want to see Simu Liu as Shang-Chi fight Donnie Yen or Tony Jaa. Simu Liu keeps Shang-Chi dramatically grounded in his struggle for independence and acceptance from his father. Simu Liu is obviously an actor to watch for as I immediately felt drawn to his charismatic aura and pleasant manner. Shang-Chi is certainly one of my new favorite Marvel superheroes. Tony Leung Chiu-wai's curious immortal villain Xu Wenwu also known as The Mandarin brings a daring gravitas and tender emotions for the forefront of Shang-Chi. It's cool to see a fearsome Mandarin on the silver screen. His presence gives the film credibility, since he's a Hong Kong acting legend for In the Mood for Love among his other iconic pictures. But Tony Leung is truly captivating in Shang-Chi with his every nuanced move and hardened feelings for his children and devastating grief for his beloved wife. Tony Leung's kung fu skills are brilliant, scary, and fast as ever. He has not lost a step since Red Cliff or The Grandmaster. Tony Leung can be a brutal warlord, caring father, cruel kung fu teacher, mourning husband, cold parent, vicious fighter, and obsessed widower all in Shang-Chi. Awkwafina is hilarious and lovable as Shang-Chi's best friend and possible girlfriend Katy Chen. I adore Awkwafina as she's so pretty and funny. She proved her dramatic skills in Lulu Wang's indie drama The Farewell and Awkwafina uses her natural charm and cute charisma to win you over. I appreciate that Katy is involved in the fighting with her neat archery by the end. I love Awkwafina and I'm so glad she was cast in Shang-Chi for such a high profile Marvel role. She's got this sweet friendship with Simu Liu's Shang-Chi as you totally buy they could be in love with their romantic chemistry. Jodi Long is funny as Awkwafina's character Katy's mother Mrs. Chen. Meng'er Zhang is stunningly gorgeous and awesome as Shang-Chi's fearless fighting sister Xu Xialing. I am floored by Meng'er Zhang's really cool fight with Simu Liu's Shang-Chi. She is amazing. You buy her hurt feelings of abandonment and fierce attitude resenting Shang-Chi and Xu Wenwu. She has a real screen presence and I'm happy she's returning for the sequel. Fala Chen is breathtakingly beautiful as Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li with amazing kung fu fighting capabilities straight out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with the floating slow motion and all. Michelle Yeoh is steadfast, wise, and strong as Ying Nan. I'm happy we got to see her fight Shang-Chi as she taught him advanced kung fu. Yuen Wah's funny supporting role as Master Guang Bo is very nice, especially opposite Awkwafina. Sir Ben Kingsley cameos as Trevor Slattery in a fun and appreciated cameo that redeems Marvel's ruining The Mandarin in Iron Man 3. Florian Munteanu's massive stature is intimidating as is his tough fighting as Razor Fist. Ronny Chieng is very funny in his cameo as underground fight coordinator Jon Jon. Benedict Wong, Tim Roth, Mark Ruffalo, and Brie Larson's cameos were unexpected and set up for Shang-Chi as our newest Avenger and a potentially fierce sequel against The Ten Rings. Editors Nat Sanders, Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir, and Harry Yoon cut so sharply around all the action and gently for the intimate dramatic moments in Shang-Chi. It's so quickly paced and neatly cut, so Shang-Chi never overstays its welcome for 132 minutes. Cinematographer Bill Pope's framing is gorgeous and possibly Marvel's nicest shot film. His close-ups and medium shots for characters emotionally reacting is as absorbing as his brilliant wide shots. Sue Chan's production design builds temples and fight clubs with a colorful zeal and detailed worldbuilding. Set decorator Christopher Kelley has all these artifacts and heirlooms that feel appropriate for each Asian home. Art directors Richard Hobbs, Sean Hargreaves, Ulrich Zeidler, and Kirby Feagan create all these Asian statues, folklore creature designs, and fantasy environments that look stellar in the vivid visual effects. Composer Joel P. West writes these gorgeous and understated Asian melodies with traditional instruments. I love Joel P. West's music for Shang-Chi with his sweeping epic atmosphere and earnest emotional themes. Shang-Chi also features a wicked soundtrack, hand picked by Destin Daniel Cretton I'd imagine, full of modern Asian hip hop. I love hearing modern rap in Marvel's movies like in Black Panther. Sound designers Jeremy Bowker and Katy Wood have booming blasts for the Ten Rings powers and mixing the new songs among the voices. Costume designers Kym Barrett and Joy Cretton create cool dragon scale armor for Shang-Chi and Katy Chen like The Mandarin. I really love their chic contemporary costumes for all the ladies throughout Shang-Chi. Make-up artists Quinton Wallace and Eliza Campagna manage to make every single person look stunning, yet maintain a natural beauty. In conclusion, Shang-Chi is a fantastic film from visionary director Destin Daniel Cretton. Simu Liu and Awkwafina are real stars and go nicely against Tony Leung's Mandarin.",13-Feb-22,4.5,0.116,0.577,0.307,0.9999,,,,,,

Jianwu S,"Great movie! I enjoyed it very much! Updates: Only mentioned the bad sides from my previous review. Let me put some good side here: - The fightings are really good! Best among all the marvel movies! A lot of long takes, really entertaining! When auntie tried to teach ShangChi, you can feel how the fighting turns from a very heavy, hard-core one into a more gentle but even powerful one. It's about cultivating the enemy's force by turning the direction of the enemy's fist. It's also the power we believe that water has: overcome the strong by applying some soft and gentle methods. Interestingly, Wong used that trick in his battle too. [BTW: when that guy took out two knives, I thought it was Loki. Can we let Loki fight with more magics? If it burns money for special effects, can we have at least some teleport tricks pls pls pls? TAT] - The animal CGs are really cool! You know these animals were Phoenix, Nine-tailed fox, Kirins without saying it. - some details about WenWu: 1. I don't think Wenwu was being sexist to his daughter. 1000 years ago, society was generally sexist. However, when he got defeated by her wife, he showed admiration instead of being angry. It means he accepted the fact. And when the kids were young, the whole family trained together. But after Ying Li died, he stopped her training, but still, he didn't send her to learn some ""female"" stuff as the stereotypes. I think it was because Lingling reminds him of his wife, and he was trying to escape from what happened. 2. Wenwu trained ShangChi not entirely for revenge. He told ShangChi when he was young, that he would like to give the ten rings if he grows strong enough. I was confused at first: why Wenwu did not seek revenge himself but told ShangChi to. Then I realized, ShangChi was there seeing her mother fight till death to protect him and his sister. Wenwu wanted ShangChi to have the power to protect himself and her sister. Wenwu made a ""mistake"" when he release the bad guys, which lead to Ying li's death. So he wanted to teach ShangChi not to make the same ""mistake"" again. He still cares about his children, but not in a way people understand, not even ShangChi and LingLing could understand. 3. Wenwu put incense in front of Ying li's photo, so he knew deep inside that she was dead. But he was running away from the fact. He thought he was so powerless, that he couldn't do anything to stop her from death. He couldn't make something up for her. ====================================================== Some suggested changes I am thinking: Maybe when Guangbo got caught by the birds, Katy could take several shots but missed because she hurried to save him so was not able to calm down to aim. But then, she found there is only one arrow remaining, so she calms down and reminds the line auntie Ying Nan said (if she could explain to her in both languages would be better), and make the great shot at the evil dragon. Also, in the end, I think it would be better if the good dragon is not lying on the ground resting and letting the two kids drop. We believe water is the source of the dragon, and the dragon also represents kings, royals, etc. It would be great if the scene was like the dragon dropping them down while standing still in the water and dropping them using its body, and throwing them to the tail to land these kids. Then quickly go back into the lake(actually dragons live in the sea but I think any water is fine). BTW: the only downside I see as a Chinese viewer: The Chinese lines from Google translation sucks. You can understand, but it's not the words you will say in daily life if you wanna express the same thing. Maybe same as the paragraphs I just wrote above.

cecilia n,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must-see movie because of its cultural significance and outstanding scenes from other American films. The movie has a powerful message about the hardships caused by family which is portrayed through the interpretations of the actors, the setting of the film, and the computer-generated imagery (CGI). The movie incorporates Asian cultures and traditions such as the Great Protector, a Chinese dragon, and Tai Chi, an ancient martial art technique. The Asian American audience will be able to relate to the film because it includes a variety of Asian customs used by the characters. The viewers will most likely relate to Shang Chi the main character because he is an Asian American who has stopped practicing his culture due to living in America. This movie truly deserves to be considered a Marvel film due to its complex scenes and visuals. Finally, I suggest everyone to watch Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings because it increases cultural awareness in America and educates the audience about Asian cultures.",1-Feb-22,5,0.01,0.903,0.087,0.9325,,,,,,

Darryl M,"In 2018, the Marvel Cinematic Universe opened its doors to telling stories centered on people of color, providing the audiences with the rich, lush history of Wakanda and the Wakandan peoples. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a cultural revolution, but the impact Black Panther had on the moviegoing audience is undeniable. Since then, the MCU has released two female centered films in Captain Marvel and Black Widow and now we've arrived at Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, the first superhero movie to focus on characters of Chinese heritage. With this unveiling of a new corner of the connected universe comes new threats, new wonders, and new heroes to root for. Shang-Chi, originally appearing in Marvel Comics' Master of Kung Fu in the 1970s, now has an updated origin story for the modern times and a cast to reflect contemporary sensibilities. Opening with a fight scene that has an almost dream-like, ethereal storybook quality, the movie is packed with tons of action, heart, and humor. The father and son theme that is always so prevalent in the MCU is once again on full display here, this time coupled with a theme of legacies and living up to one's potential. Both Shang-Chi and his friend Katy are at peace with their low key lives as valets while both have parental figures who want more from them. In Shang-Chi's case, his father Wenwu wants him to eventually take his side as master of the Ten Rings, a multinational crime syndicate (a Rainbow Coalition of crime). That, paired with Wenwu's notion that this departed wife, Shang-Chi's mother, is still alive and being held captive in a mystical city, are the heart of the film, complete with great worldbuilding, awesome fight scenes, and amazing visuals. With Black Widow and now Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Phase Four of the MCU continues with the relative low stakes that comes after the insurmountable high of Avengers: Endgame. In Shang-Chi, a single village is at peril as Wenwu will stop at nothing to save his wife. Accompanying Wenwu are the ten rings, ten mystical arm bands that imbue the wearer with superhuman abilities. If you're one for explanations, you won't find any here as the rings are never fully explored beyond looking cool and being used to kick ass. One of the positives of the film is the fact that questions are left to be answered in the inevtiable sequel. Speaking of sequels, both end credits set up to help fully integrate the characters into the wider scope of the MCU while also serving as a platform for a continuation of Shang-Chi and sister Xialing's personal stories. While thoroughly entertaining, the film isn't without faults. As is the seemingly the norm for superhero movies, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' third act devolves into a CGI fest that at times is hard to follow visually. Without risking spoilers, the final battle, a mixture of natural and mystical elements, is choppy and confusing. It doesn't quite reach the levels of Wonder Woman bad, but there was potential for a more emotionally satisfying climax that was somewhat glossed over in favor of what we got. Also, from a comics perspective, the choice to include a location that draws heavy parallels to Kun-Lun (mystical city; multiple characters dressed in green and yellow, traditional Iron Fist colors; talk of the heart of a dragon) yet not outright include Iron Fist lore is a baffling one. Starring Simu Liu, Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings put the Chinese actor first and foremost, giving Liu the opportunity to display his talents. As a member of the ensemble cast of sitcom Kim's Convenience, Liu shares the screen with a number of actors and actresses, but here as the leading man he's given the spotlight to shine. Liu's easygoing charm and affable nature will quickly win over audiences and endear them to the character. Liu's dramatic chops are on display as well as Shang-Chi spends the film clashing with both his sister and his father's way of life. Liu's Shang-Chi is here to stay in the MCU and after seeing his performance in his first outing, Marvel Studios has proven yet again one of their biggest talents lies in their ability to cast the right person for the right role. As such, Hong Kong born actor Tony Leung's first major introduction to western audiences as Wenwu finally gives Americans a chance to see one of the best living actors on display. Liu's style of quiet, pensive, deliberately nuanced acting isn't a major focus in Shang-Chi; the character of Wenwu is just a few steps above a Phase One villain. Similarly, Ray Winstone's Dreykov in Black Widow (while severely less developed than Wenwu), also has the feel of a Phase One villain which feeds into the idea of the MCU wiping the slate clean and resetting expectations back to their beginnings. Still, Leung is a joy to watch whenever he's on screen and his chemistry when paired with Liu makes for strong material. Awkwafina as Katy continues her trend of seemingly being Awkwafina in every role she's cast in. From Ocean's Eight to Crazy Rich Asians to Shang-Chi, her ebullient line delivery and acting style is at this point either well-worn or a comfortable blanket, depending on the penchant of the viewer. Katy's chemistry with Shang-Chi is undeniable, however, as the pair make for possibly the best on screen cinematic coupling since Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. The brilliance of this pairing lies not in a good romantic subplot, but two incredibly close friends, ready to help each other out in any circumstance. If Jimmy Woo and Darcy are our Mulder and Scully of the MCU, Shang-Chi and Katy are Harry and Heromoine, ready for wacky adventures at a moment's notice while being comfortable with the nature of their relationship. One of the standouts of the film is Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's estranged sister. Zhang manages to command the screen with something akin to pent up rage and frustration as Xialing is determined to make her own legacy in the world. Zhang's growth and progression as a friend-or-foe foil for Shang-Chi is a delight to watch thanks to strong writing for the character and strong acting from Zhang. Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, Shang-Chi is a busy movie. Audiences are introduced to not just a new hero in the MCU, but an entirely new world, something not seen since 2018. Intercutting between events of past and present, this is the first of the Marvel films to rely heavily on flashbacks to establish relationships between characters. The non linear storytelling works thanks largely in part to certain reveals that awards previously withheld information from the audience. Unfortunately, while trying to keep the storytelling fresh by bouncing from past to present, the second act still feels sluggish due to heavy expositions from Wenwu and Jian Nan. Both carry a hefty bit of dialogue as they explain to Shang-Chi (and us) what's happened before in order to lay seeds of what's to come in the third act. The third act and the pathway to the inevitable confrontation between Shang-Chi and Wenwu still manages to surprise and subvert the common martial arts expectations in a way that feel somewhat satisfying, if not a bit surprising. Cinematographer Bill Pope (The Matrix trilogy, Scott Pilgrim vs the World) continues to dazzle with brilliant shots that, combined with great production design, manage to capture and celebrate the Chinese culture in a way that doesn't feel cliché or lazy. Cretton and Pope manage to pay homage to a number of films via the cinematography that includes both Kill Bill volume 1 and Skyfall. Of all the questions surrounding Shang-Chi prior to its release, going all the way back to its 2019 San Diego ComiCon announcement, the biggest area of concern was centered on the authenticity of the fight scenes. Fans of previous Marvel-related works (looking directly at you, Iron Fist) have been burnt in the past when it comes to well staged fight choreography. Thankfully that's not the case here, as the fight scenes are well crafted and tailored to fit the needs of each scene. Multiple styles of fighting are present, from the graceful, flowing wushu style as seen employed by Shang-Chi's mother and aunt to the more frantic, kinetic Jackie Chan-inspired style of improvised fighting Shang-Chi uses during the bus scene. Each style is well suited for the situation at hand and goes a long way to establishing the fact that there as many different styles of hand-to-hand combat as there are different Asian cultures. At no point do the fights seem lazy or unrehearsed; if there's one thing stunt coordinator Brad Allan was keen to do, it was to not repeat the mistakes of previous ventures into the genre. Overall, Shang-Chi is another feather in the cap of Marvel Studios. Finally embracing a multicultural aspect to their storytelling and recognizing that superheroes come from more places than just America, they've allowed themselves to fully open to a world of possibilities where stories steeped in any heritage can originate. A great leading performance from Simu Liu, a solid core cast, and a strongly directed film make Shang-Chi a worthy addition to Phase Four of the MCU. How it connects to the overall tapestry woven into the interconnected universe still remains to be seen, but with two stellar end credits sequences, hopes are high that our titular hero will return for more adventures with Katy in tow.",24-Jan-22,5,0.086,0.756,0.158,0.9993,,,,,,

That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch. The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told. It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment. This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful. There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance. The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act. Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.",16-Jan-22,5,0.045,0.686,0.269,0.9992,,,,,,
Waldemar S,"If you haven't seen this yet, DO IT! BEST Marvel film I've seen, hands-down.

Late R,"I'd never heard of Shang-Chi before this film was announced and I was kinda interested to see what Marvel was going to pull out of the hat for a storyline that is clearly East Asian inspired – a chance to do something different, I thought. It didn't quite turn out that way. Despite thoroughly honouring the East Asian vibe with Wuxia-inspired fights set in a variety of Asian locations, a prominent Asian cast, and tunes from Asian artists, it somehow all feels very familiar. Both visually and stylistically, Marvel films have settled into a comfy, safe, no-risk zone that makes everything they do feel the same – they're predictable and quite frankly, for the most part, they've lost that element of excitement. After a decade, it's time to change things up and this was a wasted opportunity to do it. Is it bad film then? Well, that depends what you're looking for. It's got everything you'd expect your classic Marvel film to have, complete with big visuals, explosive action, and a great cast with Tony Leung, Akwafina, and a certain someone all stealing the show. At the very least, it passes as time-killing, forgettable and fun popcorn entertainment. In short, if you want more of the same, you're gonna love it; but if you were hoping for something different, then you're outta luck.",16-Jan-22,5,0.052,0.795,0.153,0.9564,,,,,,
Michael M,"In some ways Shang-Chi is an exciting new departure for the MCU. In many others though, it's just another MCU film. That said, I like MCU films, but yeah this is mostly another origin story. It's a heroes journey with a fun comic relief, lots of CGI fight scenes, and a handful of cameos from other films. Don't get me wrong though, the formula works. What spices it up a bit is some impressive hand-to-hand combat choreography that is somewhat new to the MCU and glorious to watch. As a martial arts fan, I enjoyed these moments a lot, even with the filter of CGI surroundings. It also has a surprisingly dense mythology of both real world myth and Marvel myth that makes a fun world, and a villain with a sympathetic goal. It's not Marvel's best, in particular some pacing issues drag the whole thing down a bit, but it's still a solid origin story that does enough new.",15-Jan-22,0.5,0.092,0.634,0.273,0.9891,,,,,,

Bo H,I must say. I don't understand what everyone loves about this film. i love the MCU. but the film travels too many logical gaps in the entire MCU for me so that I was rather annoyed. Of course the action is good. But that alone is not enough for me with an MCU. And within these logic gaps I see only one chance. The film takes place in an alternate universe and only really finds its way to us after DR. Strange. then I would be satisfied. so currently unfortunately a rivet.,14-Jan-22,0.5,0.113,0.741,0.146,0.524,,,,,,

Vincent A,"Marvel origin story crossed with fantasy kung-fu movie. The story is a product of formula, not art, so much so that you can predict the ending half way through the movie. And the story points that they have made up for the movie, such as the timeline, absolutely fall apart when you start to do the math. The lead is not a believable action hero, there was a reason he was cast in a comedy before his role in Shang-Chi, and while Marvel movies have doubled down on comedy since Ragnarok the actors still need to be appropriate for their other roles. Awkwafina and Yeoh are good in their roles but also very familiar at this point. The movie also injects chinese culture to the point of absurdity, such having a lantern ceremony of remembrance at a time when they should instead be digging graves for actual funerals.

Michael J,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a fantastic introduction to a figure we've never seen before in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action set piece in this film is one of the most innovative and entertaining the MCU has to offer, from hand-to-hand combat to the kaiju war. Even while the film is action-packed, it is also heavy on drama, particularly with the tension between Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), her sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and their father Wenwu (Tony Leung), who is one of the MCU's best villains. Despite one-dimensional characters and humor that don't always land, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings takes the MCU's best qualities and amps them up tenfold, leaving a lasting imprint on a new hero.",8-Jan-22,5,0.09,0.747,0.163,0.8955,,,,,,

Andrea R,"Too little and too late, that's the simple single-sentence review for Black Widow which finally released after four post-production delays. Of course, those delays are not the reason why this film came about too late, that was always going to be an issue. Black Widow takes place between the 2016 Captain America: Civil War and the 2018 Avengers: Infinity War with Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) being a fugitive on the run following the Avengers breaking up over disagreements regarding government surveillance. This middle-of-the-road placement of the film doesn't affect the main narrative much as it's isolated to characters unique to this film rather than the more crossover-heavy films the MCU have put out lately, but at the same time it can't be ignored that the film feels like it should have been released in 2017 rather than after the 2019 Avengers: Endgame where Natasha ultimately was killed off. Her fate in Endgame being sealed does hurt some of the tension in the film since even if you wouldn't expect a Black Widow film to kill her off, the fact that it literally can't kill her off alters your perspective quite a bit. It's just unfortunate and a testament to how Disney's reluctance to make this film for the longest time has left scars in the script that can't heal. The story involves Natasha reuniting with her foster-sister, Yelena (Florence Pugh), from before her indoctrination into The Red Room, the global network of assassins that take little girls and turn them into programmed killers. Natasha and Yelena set out to take down The Red Room. It's fairly straight forward and you most likely figured out the few twists in the story from just watching the trailer. It's clear that the film wants to evoke more of a James Bond vibe than a typical superhero film, from the opening title sequences set to an awkward slowed down cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the more visceral and violent action scenes feeling right out of the Daniel Craig Bond films that take up the first half of the film. It's a breath of fresh air that unfortunately is lost in the final act when it becomes a more standard superhero film despite all this. The performances in the film works quite well with Johansson looking far more comfortable as Natasha in this film than in any of the seven films she was in before this. Pugh as Yelena is the stand-out star and the hints that she'll take up the Black Widow mantle in future MCU media is something I welcome. Black Widow is not a terrible film, but it's also not a decent film. It's a dull if inoffensive action adventure that awkwardly tries to slot itself in between other films to not have to deal with the fact that they waited so long to make this film that the character had both been killed off in-universe and lost most of her popularity from nearly a decade ago. It's certainly not worth going back to theaters or paying a Disney+ premium price for, that's for sure.",6-Apr-22,2.5,0.134,0.781,0.085,-0.9877,,,,,,

Bryson Z,"I have absolutely no idea why this movie was released in 2021 or why it was the opening act for the fourth phase of the MCU. This movie would have been immensely more interesting had it been released following Civil War which is when the story takes place. The fact of the matter is that it's a story that didn't need to be told for a character whose storyline is finished in the present of the MCU. While I believe you can tell a story about a character who is no longer alive, you have to make the story matter. This story absolutely didn't matter. It's serves as a quasi-origin story at the beginning with a side story about Natasha dealing with her life as an assassin with no family. There are some touching moments, and the characters have decent chemistry together, but the movie felt so unnecessary. It was clearly made to be a big-budget 2 hour lead in to the Hawkeye show. This seems to be the beginning of a dark period for the MCU. Many of its heavy hitters have tied a bow on their storylines which means Marvel will try to squeeze out as many stories as they can from any other superhero still remaining. What's unfortunate is that Far From Home made me feel like the MCU could continue even without Iron Man and Captain America. However, if the future MCU movies continue to maintain the quality of Black Widow, I'll probably just stick with the movies of established heroes that are remaining from the Infinity Saga.",4-Apr-22,2.5,0.044,0.888,0.068,0.6712,,,,,,

The two sisters go in pursuit of the red room where the experience happened, to kill the person responsible for the experience.

Lou P,"Black Widow was produced by Cate ShortLand in 2021. Natasha, the main character is played by Scarlett Johansson.

Few years later, Natasha side with American and she became an Avengers. Yolana escape from black widow organisation and they fight together Russian government to free every black widow. The plot is basic to action movie, but the ending is poignant. Special effects are superb, especially with pan shot and long shot. The acting is stunning, the casting is amazing. The script is very interesting, characters are dive few years later after the Cold War, but we could feel tension between USA and Russia.

There are definitely little winks and easter eggs related to the comics. However, there are some negative things, the villain as mostly everybody has stated, was a bit underwhelming. The actress was great and all, just needed better writing and there is definitely one little quip in regards to the Avengers scene between Nat and Hawkeye about Budapest that I don't know, I felt it didn't work.

I loved the way Yelena indulged in teasing her big sister. Those scenes seemed so natural and believable despite them taking place in a world of deadly spies and super powered beings. The villains were suitably villainous and the heroes and anti heroes provided many shades of grey to spice up a well paced script that was also packed full of a vast quantity of Easter eggs. Each time I watched the movie I spot another one. I watched it three times within a relatively short period I've seen several other MCU movies three times but only with Infinity War, End Game, Black Panther and Thor Ragnarok did I watch them each three times within the period of just a few weeks after their release dates.

Ashley L,"One sentence for Black Widow: A perfect origin story movie that we should have gotten much sooner. Overall score: 8/10. Do I think that this movie is perfect? No. It has its flaws—most of the comedy lands in the film on your first watch. The second viewing leaves much to be desired, but it is still enjoyable. The major problem with this film is that it serves as a platform for Florence Pugh's Yelena instead of being the origin story that Scarlett Johansson deserved years prior. It is a travesty that there has yet to be a stand-alone Hulk movie with Mark Ruffalo, but they will make the same mistake they did with Scarlett Johansson. I think that for three Iron Man films (the second and third ones have not held up) and for the Black Widow movie to be released via streaming and in theaters severely crippled this movies' chances of succeeding. It is witty political commentary while also being a kickass superhero flick. The cast is excellent, do not get me started on David Harbour's Red Guardian. My only gripe is that we do not know when some of these characters will return. With Yelena pretty up taking the mantle of the Black Widow and being approached by Valentina in the end credits scene, we are looking at a group of antiheroes/bad guys coming together with a U.S. Agent and a disgruntled Yelena team-up. Maybe Marc Spector (Moon Knight) is also coming into the fray. The visuals - 8/10. The villain - 0/10 that is not the Taskmaster we know and love. The action - 9/10. The comedy - 9/10, dad bods, need I say more? The plot - 6/10, very linear, but still solid. Overall, 8/10, my only major gripes are that it did not come out before Natasha's death, as the movie feels like there are no real consequences and the fact that Taskmaster was ripped to shreds in this movie. Also, the reveal is blatant. When will Marvel make a morally egregious sociopath like Kilgrave come into the mix? Hopefully, soon with all the Netflix shows moving onto Disney+. OH and #revivejessicajones I recommend streaming this movie with the family. A solo viewing of this film would be great too. What is amazing about this movie is that you do not need to know about any previous MCU lore to enjoy this movie, and I think that is what makes it so special. Give it a watch!

Instead the ending felt rushed and a bit campy while the opening was most definitely the strongest act.

Matthew D,"Russia's espionage network meets The Avengers' spy. Director Cate Shortland's superheroine espionage thriller Black Widow (2021) is surprisingly gritty with a bleak realness and dark subject matter far more mature than most Marvel movies. I loved Black Widow! Executive producer Scarlett Johansson picked the right director in Cate Shortland for Natasha Romanoff's origin and continuation film. Her action sequences feel visceral in every punch and shot. I most appreciate her dramatic scenes though. However, I do wish that producer Kevin Feige had made Black Widow back after Iron Man 2, when Jon Favreau first introduced her killer combatant and intelligent spy to us instead of after Marvel already killed her off in Avengers: Endgame. Hopefully, Yelena gets her own solo film soon since we cannot get more Black Widow movies with Scarlett Johansson. Cate Shortland's striking direction really touched me as she clearly had a feminine empathy for Russian girls indoctrinated into Communist propaganda and spy programs as they're manipulated and abused into child assassinations. Shortland finds a similar serious dramatic tone and haunting atmosphere as she approaches Black Widow like an indie drama for the majority of this intriguing Marvel movie. You can tell Shortland really cared about these characters and this grim story. Her raw emotional storytelling and sincerely feminist style are quite moving with Black Widow's harrowing themes of abuse, trauma, manipulation, lies, family, and death are brought to the front of your eyes and heart. Writers Jac Schaeffer, Eric Pearson, and Ned Benson take Russian abuse of girls seriously, while balancing the intense drama with exciting action encounters and morbidly deadpan humor. Black Widow is sure to shock and disturb the younger viewers, but older audiences might enjoy Black Widow as I thoroughly did. Shortland was an interesting choice for Black Widow's director as she leans into the hard feelings and harder hitting action. I found Black Widow's hand to hand combat sequences incredibly well choreographed and effective. Black Widow features Marvel's coolest up close and personal fight sequences. I've always liked Scarlett Johansson's fights, but Yelena and The Red Guardians' battles were as cool. Scarlett Johansson is very raw and compelling as Natasha Romanoff as she is reunited with her fake Russian mandated family and comes to terms with her childhood abuse. Johansson is completely committed to Natasha's hurt and conflicted feelings with her tear filled eyes and hard glares alongside Johansson's other complex nuances. She's a phenomenal dramatic actress and Cate Shortland finally lets Natasha Romanoff feel like a real woman and intricate figure, not just a fabulous superheroine with outstanding fighting techniques. Johansson really sells all of Black Widow's intelligent spy manipulating and lying as well as the fierce combat. All the flips, punches, kicks, and spy devices are super cool to see. Scarlett Johansson is simply breathtaking to watch in every moment of Black Widow. I'm going to really miss Scarlett Johansson in The MCU as Black Widow has consistently been one of my favorite superheroes in Marvel's movie series. She has a fun sisterly rivalry chemistry with Florence Pugh's Yelena on screen that's quite fun too. I only wish Scarlett had been given her solo Black Widow film earlier. Florence Pugh's extraordinarily tough, serious, yet playful spy sister Yelena Belova is awesome. Florence is very funny with her deadpan jokes as Yelena that steals every scene alongside her fearsome hand to hand combat that rivals Johansson's killer Black Widow. Florence is absolutely stunning with a natural beauty and pleasant cuteness to her that makes her delightful. I hope she gets her own solo Yelena picture soon. Rachel Weisz is startlingly beautiful and fascinating as Natasha and Yelena's cold and driven mother Melina Vostokoff. I like her flirting with David Harbour's hilarious and charming Alexei Shostakoff. Harbour's Alexei is a brutal, tough, yet supportive father that is a pleasure to watch with his insecurities over Captain America and strength boasts as the neat Red Guardian. I found his Communist propaganda and heavy action fights as Red Guardian a blast to watch. I hope we get an entire Red Guardian movie wherein he fights his archnemesis spy Captain America. Ray Winstone's evil Russian spy abuser Dreykov is intimidating and creepy. Olga Kurylenko is still lovely under all her make-up and says so much emotionally with tearful eyes and expressions. Child actresses Ever Anderson and Violet McGraw are fabulous as Young Natasha and Young Yelena during Black Widow's touching childhood flashbacks. William Hurt is ever the stalwart antagonist as the American former general and Secretary of Defense Thaddeus ‘Thunderbolt' Ross. I'm intrigued as to who Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine will be in future Marvel projects. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye should be an intense combatant against Yelena. Editors Leigh Folsom Boyd and Matthew Schmidt cut smoothly between Natasha's tender flashbacks and gripping modern events. Black Widow doesn't feel its formidable 124 minutes length. I was really impressed with the gentle opening scenes with Natasha's family that lead into the gritty and arthouse opening montage during the credits. Shortland's plane shootout and Red Guardian prison breakout are incredible action sequences. Let alone, Black Widow and Yelena's brutal first fight that slays. Cate Shortland had interesting directorial choices like this and Boyd and Schmidt's editing sells the gravity of her imagery of young girls being abused and cruelly hardened into child soldiers for the Communist Russian government program of Widows molded in The Red Room. Cinematographer Gabriel Beristain's wide shots look stunning for all the natural scenes in Norway, Russia, Cuba, Ohio, and Morocco. His wide panning shots and creative perspectives allow you to see all of Black Widow, Yelena, and Red Guardian's intense close quarters combat in detail. I really appreciate the intimate feel of Beristain's close-up shots of Scarlett and Florence, especially. You feel you're with Natasha and Yelena every moment emotionally. Production designers Charles Wood's sets make you believe in Black Widow's world of hideaways and Russia's sinister spy organizations. Art directors Mike Stallion, Peter James, Jim Barr, Chris 'Flimsy' Howes, Sarah Ginn, Abdellah Achir, Andrew Proctor, Tara Ilsley, and Rob Mear create really nice natural environments for each location. Their natural style fits cinematographer Gabriel Beristain's careful character driven framing. Set decorators John Bush, Jess Royal, Amin Rharda, Arnaud Putman, Sam Farr, and Nathan Payne create these quaint homes and hideouts with plenty of real props instead of endless CGI everywhere. I think visual effects artists Nick Brown, Joe Howes, and Reetu Aggarwal did a great job with most of Black Widow's CGI that looks real, but in the explosive finale a few fiery explosions and characters diving into the sky look fake. I don't hate their CGI, but it's my only real critique of Black Widow. Composer Lorne Balfe's score is really emotional with sweeping melodies and a majestic quality. You feel the epic Russian grandeur in Balfe's music that incorporates choirs and symphonic orchestration. Sound designers Shannon Mills and Samson Neslund create natural ambience during conversations and fearsome blows for Red Guardians punches and Black Widows strikes. Costume designer Jany Temime created cool new white Widow uniforms for Black Widow and Yelena. The stylish all black outfit for all the Widows is classic. I love Red Guardian's bulky crimson armor and mask. You really believe Red Guardian could be Captain America's rival. Make-up artists Hayat Ouled Dahhou, Adrian Rigby, Marzenna Fus-Mickiewicz, Clare Eastham, Salima Oulad Dahhou, Kat Ali, Liz Bradbear, Jenna Roseanne, and Drew Daniele Nastasi did outstanding work for Black Widow. Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, and Rachel Weisz look gorgeous and natural with lovely make-up choices. Johansson's red hair and Florence's blonde braids have never looked prettier. Meanwhile David Harbour looks gritty and fun as Red Guardian with his Karl Marx knuckle tattoos and back tats of Red Guardian and his daughters. In all, Black Widow has a lot of heart and realistic drama for a uniquely touching Marvel movie. Cate Shortland's direction gives us genuine emotion and complex motivations for an absorbing, sincere motion picture and well made action spectacle that's exhilarating.",12-Feb-22,3,0.128,0.667,0.205,0.9992,,,,,,

Neil V,"I wasn't a big fan of Black Widow. Unlike other Marvel movies, I'm not sure I'd be bothered to watch again which is a first for me in the MCU. I absolutely love her character and the addition of Florence Pugh (who stole the show imo) but I just felt this was a swing and a miss. I enjoyed aspects of the film, but it really didn't feel like I was watching a movie about one of my favorite super heroes. It felt more like an action flick with a crime fighting theme. I feel like Johansson was still great and true to the character but as a stand alone film, it was a little boring. Had this aired before Infinity Wars/Endgame, I likely would've enjoyed it a lot more than I did, but it just felt a bit needless knowing that Black Widow is gone.

Darryl M,"What's the best way to handle a movie where the lead character has already died in a previous film? Why should audiences care about the stakes when we've already seen some form of resolution? Black Widow as a film is a slippery story to shoehorn into an interconnected universe where the narrative is mostly moving forward, not stopping to give pause for past adventures. Some could say this circumstance is of Marvel Studio's (read: Ike Perlmutter) own doing: had we gotten a Black Widow film sooner, it can be almost conclusively agreed on that the story would've hit in a different way. While the movie serves to fill a gap of time between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, there's still some odd decisions made in the telling of the story, especially in the final scenes. Bracketed by scenes featuring the seemingly ever-present Secretary of State General Thunderbolt Ross, Black Widow is a story firmly centered on Marvel's second greatest spy: Natasha Romanoff. After being contacted by Yelena Belova, another product of the same Red Room we get glimpses of in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Natasha must simultaneously flee capture at the hands of Ross while working to bring down the establishment that made her. At its core, Black Widow shares most of its DNA with the other spy thriller in the MCU, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (which also stars Johansson). No world-ending event, no invading aliens, no angry gods to be smote in this film, just some good old fashioned bad guys: Black Widow is a pure action spectacle from beginning to end. Incredible chase scenes, strong character work, and a bit of clever storytelling make this one of the stronger entries into the overall MCU canon. With this likely being her swan song in the MCU, Scarlett Johansson brings her best portrayal to the character ever. With almost a decade of time and numerous appearances large and small to hone and perfect the character, Black Widow has her at her most locked in and nailed down. As Johansson is easily one of the finest actors within the MCU stable (she was nominated for an Oscar twice in the same year, a rare feat), she's finally given the opportunity to shine as the lead, handling the weightier moments of the film. Conversely, Florence Pugh's first entry into the universe lands her a huge splash as audiences are introduced to Yelena Belova, another member of the infamous Red Room. While Pugh's Belova doesn't quite have the same amount of screen time as Natasha has, it's clear that part of the purpose of this movie was to introduce Belova as a potential ally/foil for another character later on down the road. While some are upset that Johansson has to share large chunks of the screen with her replacement in her final film, the interactions between the two are some of the most enjoyable moments of the movie. Belova is used to remind Johansson not just of who she used to be, but what she's become and how far she's progressed. Rachael Weiss and David Harbour as Natasha and Yelena's parental figures each get a little time to shine on their own as well. Unfortunately, Black Widow falls into the same trap as some Phase 1 and Phase 2 MCU movies did of having a weak villain. Ray Winstone's Dreykov, head of the Red Room isn't revealed until late in the second act and when he is, there's little about him that sets him up to be a worthy adversary for Natasha; in the end he's mostly all talk and swagger and easily dispatched of, similar to Iron Man's Obadiah Stane or Ant-Man's Darren Cross. Possibly the largest disappointment of the film was the lack of Taskmaster doing what audiences came to see the character do: kick ass. As one of Marvel Comic's beloved lesser-known villains, Taskmaster's ability to mimic any movement that results in Natasha having to basically fight any possible combination of her Avengers teammates is a concept that falls flat of being fully explored. While the character is a fun watch in the action scenes we get, the possibility of getting some real juicy stunts featuring the moves of heroes we've come to love seemed to be chopped, perhaps due to trimming down the runtime. Director Cate Shortland has become yet another in the staple of MCU directors either plucked from obscurity (Chloe Zhao's name did not have the heat it does now when Eternals was announced) or a complete surprise (""the guys who did Community?""). Even more incredulous, each one of her three previous full feature length films failed to recoup their production budget, making her nomination to helm a long-awaited film set in an unprecedented box office bonanza franchise one of the riskiest decisions Disney and Marvel Studios have made yet. Shortland's direction on Black Widow is nothing short of top notch. Beautiful imagery, meticulously planned action scenes, and character work both subtle and overt all weave together to make the 134 minute runtime feel like a fun breeze. The assignment to give Natasha a good sendoff as well as introduce Yelena Belova into the overall world was a tricky task to handle and Shortland delivers. The interactions between Romanoff and Belova are believable and heartfelt and the underlying theme of a family strongest when together isn't preachy or heavy-handed. Amazing cinematography from Germain McMicking includes both dazzling shot compositions as well as chaotic action that's still easy for the audience's eye to follow. Great editing which leads to a good pace for the film keeps viewers interested and invested throughout. Overall, Black Widow stands apart as one of the finest standalone movies within the MCU. While this only increases the frustrations of previous year's wondering what took us so long to get it, the film was well worth the weight. Dynamic action setpieces, strong acting, and sure, confident directing from Shortland combine to create the feeling of an old school spy thriller set within the superhero universe. While Black Widow has no overall earth-shattering impact on future events of the MCU (that we know of yet), it still serves as a refreshing breather after the events of Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Even with the elements that don't fully work, the overall enjoyment of having an MCU flick back on the big screen and the pleasure of hearing the flipping pages over the opening fanfare herald a return to form for the juggernaut that dominated our theaters for a decade. If this truly is Scarlett Johansson's final performance as Natasha Romanoff the Black Widow, the character went out on an explosive high note that is sure to delight audiences the world over.",24-Jan-22,4,0.064,0.796,0.14,0.9982,,,,,,

Mister S,"Worst MCU film. Spoiler alert. Why? 1) They did not flesh out Natasha's background. No Russian training? Instead, I got a family of fake, corny former spies who all yearned for nostalgia, which was to be a fake family once again? Really? 2) The action in this film was directed by a teenager who seemd to have spent all their youth in the rural countryside, milked cows, picked berries out of a pigs snout and watched reruns of Superman IV: Quest for Peace. I mean, those fights broke physics, made her appear beyond human, and were short and lacked imagination. Did I say cheesy? Poor Cgi/green screen running away from an explosion 80s shot? 3) The film's antagonist was 2 dimensional, lacked substance, and I can care less about him. Did not feel grounded, rather a villain who wore cheap cologne, and black widow held it against him because he stank up her aroma and vibe. 4) Heavily misused Red Guardian. Made him a comic relief. Should have replaced his head piece with a jester hat. 5) Was this a genuine MCU film embodied with creativity and imaginative story-telling? No. Was it necessary to make? No. Was it a cash grab?

Max A,"The first time I saw this movie I wasn't happy enough with the results, now that I rewatch... I'm still not happy enough, but I appreciate the movie more. My main problem with this movie is that instead of telling the origins of Natasha Romanoff (well, they partially do), they prefer to go with a solo adventure that happens after the character is well established (the events of this movie occur just after those of Captain America: Civil War). I know that making a PG-13 movie about how maniac kidnappes little girls to turn them into assassins is not very Disney-like, however I think the movie could have been so much more. Also, why on Earth did Red Guardian had ""Karl Marx"" tattoed on his fists? Like WTF!? That's a horrible stereotype, but I get it, he was motivated by a political ideology (still doesn't make sense to me, I have never known of a comunist with that kind of tattoo LOL). One thing that I have to say is that action scenes on this movie are great, also the Yelena Bulova character felt so rigth.

Samuel L,"Entertaining enough and a definite improvement on Tom Holland's first Spider Man film, but the writing was still far worse than it should have been. The plot was again too linked to the Avengers/Iron Man films and pathetically unbelievable thanks to the pretend superhero, massive holograms, and glasses that give you access to thousands of military drones. There was far too much technology and not enough superpowers, with lots of irrelevant moments, such as the Nick Fury plot points. However, the travelling aspect was fun and allowed for lots of scene variety. The villain was unpredictable to start with, but his motivation was generic, his actions became predictable apart from the twist ending, and almost everything about him lacked believability, like the fact that he had a team. Nick Fury didn't need to be there and got painted in a bad light. However, Spider Man and his friends were better than the first film, although he still wasn't very competent. The pacing was acceptable, the acting was well done, the cinematography and visual effects were decent, and the soundtrack was fine.",16-Apr-22,4.5,0.141,0.691,0.168,0.2918,,,,,,

Dentrell T,"Tom Holland's sophomore appearance as Spider-Man certainly does not disappoint. Holland not only shows he can play an entertaining Spider-Man, but he also shows he understands the importance of playing a good Peter Parker as well. In this film, we see Peter try and take the roll left to him by Tony Stark (The MCU's Ben Parker to him). We see Peter continually doubt his abilities both as a superhero and a teenage boy. The amount of growth by Peter in this movie continues to show that Spider-Man is the most relatable superhero we've seen. What really shines in this movie is Peter and MJ's relationship progression. Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry no doubt due to their real-life relationship. Both play characters that made me say ""Yep, this is how awkward teenagers act"" throughout the movie. Gyllenhall's Mysterio is fun, but I would have loved to have seen him play a hero because I feel he exudes the charisma of a superhero. The mid-credit scene is a real treat for those OG Spider-Man fans with the return of J.J. Jameson. The low points of this movie are the CGI and casting of May Parker. The CGI can be great in some areas and very poor in others. Also, I kind of understand why Marvel decided to cast someone young to play May, but it's still weird. May has always been this fragile woman who has guided Peter's desire to protect the weak. But in this version, she is hooking up with Happy, so it feels a bit out of character compared to previous versions of May. I do like that Peter's identity was revealed to her after the first movie. Something about that just makes it feel like he has a partner to help him. Overall, fantastic movie. I will definitely watch this one again.",26-Mar-22,2.5,0.065,0.686,0.249,0.9971,,,,,,

Matthew C,"(VERY CLOSE TOO SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING) In Spider-man Far from home, there are a lot more funny scenes and great laughs, along with even more action packed scenes. It's just as good as Spider-man homecoming. The ending took me by complete shock, but in a great way. Tom Holland and Zendaya's performances are great and they are on top of their game as actors in this movie. Superhero fans will love this movie just as much as they've loved the Spider-Man Homecoming movie. With both of the two movies combined I definetely want too see Spider-Man: No Way Home. These are the kind of movies that are worth seeing in the movie theaters, and if Tom Holland and Zendaya ever do another Spider-Man movie, I will be seeing it in the movie theater. I'm very impressed by what they did. This time around the story was just as good and that's why I give it an amazing star rating. I love the glasses that Tom Holland gets as Peter Parker/Spider-man and everyone did a great job with the bus scene, when they drive too Prog, that scene is funny and filled with action.

Honestly the best part of the film is the cliffhanger at the end, it really feels like this film is setting the stage for the sequel rather then standing firmly on its own merits.

Emmanuel L,"50% Romantic Comedy, 50% Action Short Synopsis: Plot very similar to Home Coming but in Europe, the writers did not think of a new story. The movie makes no sense since it doesn't explain why if there were hundreds of super heroes in End Game, now it turns out that there is only Spidey? isn't Stark more likely to inherit his glasses from Pepper Pots than Peter? Why can't Peter take a phone from his partner with just his spider powers? didn't Mystery have to give permission for Peter to wear the glasses? It is worth highlighting the visual effects, unlike the cartoon here they explain Mystery's powers very well, and the illusions he uses are amazing, I think Sony is managing to turn pathetic villains into imposing villains. The end of the movie is pure Spiderman-style action, meaning he pushes himself to the limit to save the world. At least I did find a moral to this movie and that is, if you make a big mistake in your life, you correct it based on courage and effort. I give this movie a 5/10 rating, if you expect a Sam Raimi-style work of art then don't watch it, but if you expect one more episode of spidey without logic similar to cartoons then go see it.",19-Jan-22,5,0.098,0.768,0.134,0.8338,,,,,,
Random A,"Spider-Man: Far From Home, the awkward end of Phase 3 of the MCU, is a complete waste of time. It barely has any character development in it and the story focuses too much on the school trip than actually showing Peter cope with the loss of Tony Stark, his father figure. The first two-thirds of the movie was dull and did not contribute anything to the overall story, and therefore completely skippable, and the final battle surprisingly bored me even more than the other CGI final battles in the MCU. However, I will say that Mysterio is a fantastic twist villain, however the movie does not give him enough screen time as a villain as the first two-thirds focused too much on taking down the fake Elementals. This movie has extremely bad humour and some very annoying characters; the tone is lighthearted while not having any tension or stakes. The sole purpose of this movie is for Spider-Man's identity to be revealed, which only happens in a mid-credits scene. If you like watching a romantic teenage comedy with Spider-Man shoved in it somewhere, then you will enjoy this movie. However, if you are expecting a movie focusing on Peter Parker and how he copes with losing his mentor and father figure, then this movie is total garbage.",18-Jan-22,5,0.146,0.745,0.11,-0.8379,,,,,,

Rich R,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great follow-up to the successful first MCU Spider-Man solo movie. Just like before, it showcases one of Spider-Man's most popular villains. Jake Gyllenhaal acting was perfect, thanks to being a seasoned actor. Excellent special effects highlighted Mysterio's powers. The twist and turns were somewhat predictable but still highly entertaining. Tom Holland once again owned the beloved iconic character. This light, cheerful and fun atmosphere is best suited for Spider-Man movies, instead of the usual dark and gritty approach of some movies in the genre. The European setting was a marketing gimmick, but it worked. Zendaya is pretty and charming, but I don't really see her as Mary Jane. But that's just me. Jason Batalon is still funny as always, providing the humor. Great direction, pacing, special effects and script. Solid, fun and entertaining!

Yes I am have watched the previous Spider-Man films, so this movie meant more to me than others since I have deeper connection to some of these characters than someone who hasn't.

Matthew D,"A thoroughly enjoyable Spider-Man trip. Director Jon Watts' superhero coming of age adventure Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) is a pleasant improvement over the fun times from Homecoming. Watts' direction takes up an ultra fast pacing for 129 minutes that feels like 45 to me. Producer Kevin Feige clearly trusted Watts to deliver after his delightful Homecoming showing with funny jokes and a frenetic modern style. Watts brings Mysterio to life with really creative magician's illusions for surreal imagery and exhilarating action that keeps you guessing. I love Mysterio and it was thrilling to never guess the twists and figure out what is real. Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wonderfully develop Peter Parker and Michelle Jones' romance drama with earnest feelings and cute teenage awkwardness. I love McKenna and Sommers' goofy humor that incorporates contemporary zoomer slang that kids will get and laugh at alongside their parents. The way they develop Peter Parker's serious dramatic mourning over Tony Stark's sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame. Tom Holland portrays Peter Parker with that charming teenage awkwardness, while also drawing upon his inner feelings over Robert Downey Jr.'s departure from The MCU and Iron Man's death. You believe Holland's Peter Parker is conflicted over being the superhero Spider-Man and just trying to have fun on his class science trip to Europe. I find his romantic chemistry with Zendaya very sweet as they're cute together. Zendaya is quite funny as MJ with her signature morbid humor and stunning stunning. I hope they develop Peter Parker and MJ's relationship more in No Way Home. I'm left intrigued for No Way Home after the hilarious reveal in Far From Home's after credits scene that must be seen. Spider-Man: Far From Home is a real blast. Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Nick Fury is very funny as his harsh words of dire encouragement and obvious frustrations with Spider-Man ghosting his phone calls. The tranquilizer scene is super funny. Jake Gyllenhaal is the reason to see Far From Home as Quentin Beck and Mysterio. Gyllenhaal draws upon his neurotic Nightcrawler character with his media obsession and totalitarian control regardless of the human cost as the manipulative Mysterio. I love how genuine, kind, patient, and paternal Gyllenhaal is with Tom Holland's Peter Parker. He completely feels like a motivated egomaniac as Gyllenhaal kills it as his illusory sociopath Beck. Mysterio is one of Spider-Man's villains and Jake Gyllenhaal lives up to the fishbowl helmeted antagonist with style. Mysterio is a top tier Marvel villain in The MCU. Marisa Tomei's Aunt May is so gorgeous and flirty. She's very protective and motherly with Tom Holland. Her dating scenes with Jon Favreau are so charming. I found Jon Favreau hilarious as Happy Hogan. His genuine advice and support to Peter Parker is legit moving as he simultaneously mourns Tony Stark's Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal as Tony Stark. Favreau gave us Iron Man and continues to delight in The MCU as Happy. Jacob Batalon's Ned is always quaint and likable as Peter Parker's dorky best friend. Tony Revolori is more likable as Peter's bully Flash, who now likes Spider-Man. Angourie Rice is truly hilarious with her deadpan delivery as the adorable Betty Brant. Her disgust at nerd culture is fun as well as her obnoxious flirting with Ned is fun. Remy Hii's third wheel love interest for MJ named Brad is a neat jerk for Peter Parker to contend with in Far From Home. Martin Starr is too funny as Peter Parker's worried teacher Mr. Harrington. J.B. Smoove is also funny as the paranoid teacher Mr. Dell. Cobie Smulders is lovely and cool as Maria Hill with more of a commanding presence than ever. I'm glad her role in The MCU is expanding. Editors Dan Lebental and Leigh Folsom Boyd impress with their fast cuts for Mysterio's sudden appearances and illusions. Cinematographer Matthew J. Lloyd loves these nice medium and wide shots that have steadfast focus and nice perspectives. Interesting how few close-ups Lloyd uses unless it's for the serious, heartfelt moments. Claude Paré's production design uses Venice, Prague, and London's natural scenery and creates lavish sets for the kids to travel. The innovative art direction and visual effects for Mysterio is groundbreaking with how inventive his magic powers look to not appear as illusions. Composer Michael Giacchino's score is exciting and funny, really matching Far From Home's tones. Anna B. Sheppard's Mysterio costume design is so cool to see on the silver screen. In all, Spider-Man: Far From Home is really entertaining, well made, and creatively made with a lot of heart. I enjoyed Far From Home as much as Homecoming, if not more.",5-Jan-22,3.5,0.082,0.653,0.266,0.9995,,,,,,

Hassan I,"Jon Watts' ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is action-packed, heartwarming and wildly entertaining sequel that proves the web-slinging hero hasn't lost his ability to marvel movie-goers despite Oscorp-orate studio rivalries. With second Spider-Man feature, Watts expands the web-slinging superhero's world through rich identity self-discovery. Through spellbinding cinematography, Watts immerses viewers into the s-Parker-ling hero's journey to confront Mysterio-us adversary on vacation to Italy. Watts' decision to shoot Spider-Man's action using aerial sequences above ground works immensely. Inspired by Sam Raimi's trilogy, Watts effectively employs aerial shots to showcase Spider-Man's newfound affection toward his superpowers. Watts showcases extraordinary control over action sequences, editing and musical score, weaving spectacular cinematic spin-off. It's hard to not marvel at Marvel-ous cast performances. Tom Holland delivers one of the finest performances of career as the web-slinging superhero. With mesmerizing expression, he signals adolescent angst, desperation and resentment of the high-school confronting alter-ego identity on a Mysterio-us trip to Italy. Zendaya is equally extraordinary in role of Mary-Jane-lized heroine that risks his own safety to keep boyfriend's identity secret. If previous iterations of Mary Jane portrayed her as damsel in distress, Zendaya brings female empowerment to character through strong demeanor. The final, most unforgettable standout is Jake Gyllenhaal. As the menacing villain Mysterio, he imbues shades of humanity into a multi-layered villain. Although ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is must-see for Spidey fans, ultimately it isn't flawless. It's goofy humor is slightly needless, more suited towards high-school specials rather than serious comic-book movies. Moreover, it builds to cliffhanger ending without satisfying resolution. Nonetheless, fans of the web-slinging hero will definitely enjoy ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. In an era of superhero fatigue, it's web-slinging sign Marvel's most friendly neighbor hasn't lost his abilities to marvel movie-goers through s-Parker-ling powers rather than his petered out exposure on world wide web despite Mysterio-us adversaries claiming it may be time for hero to hang up his suit and tie by publicly revealing identities to Oscorp-orate companies torn apart by Battle-Garfield rivalries Mag-acquired across centuries.",4-Jan-22,3.5,0.104,0.738,0.158,0.9778,,,,,,

Dario M,"On a rewatch, this is the weakest fillm of the trilogy. Yes, Holland makes a great job here, there´s a lot more of Peter Parker than Spiderman in this movie and he nails it.

I don't at all get the relationship of the two friends (I guess it was for humour, but really wasn't, and really wasn't necessary), nor why the competition for the girl just suddenly disappeared (if he was honestly interested, he would have let go so easily).

The plot was again too linked to the Avengers/Iron Man films and pathetically unbelievable thanks to the pretend superhero, massive holograms, and glasses that give you access to thousands of military drones. There was far too much technology and not enough superpowers, with lots of irrelevant moments, such as the Nick Fury plot points. However, the travelling aspect was fun and allowed for lots of scene variety. The villain was unpredictable to start with, but his motivation was generic, his actions became predictable apart from the twist ending, and almost everything about him lacked believability, like the fact that he had a team. Nick Fury didn't need to be there and got painted in a bad light. However, Spider Man and his friends were better than the first film, although he still wasn't very competent. The pacing was acceptable, the acting was well done, the cinematography and visual effects were decent, and the soundtrack was fine.",16-Apr-22,4.5,0.141,0.691,0.168,0.2918,,,,,,

Dentrell T,"Tom Holland's sophomore appearance as Spider-Man certainly does not disappoint. Holland not only shows he can play an entertaining Spider-Man, but he also shows he understands the importance of playing a good Peter Parker as well. In this film, we see Peter try and take the roll left to him by Tony Stark (The MCU's Ben Parker to him). We see Peter continually doubt his abilities both as a superhero and a teenage boy. The amount of growth by Peter in this movie continues to show that Spider-Man is the most relatable superhero we've seen. What really shines in this movie is Peter and MJ's relationship progression. Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry no doubt due to their real-life relationship. Both play characters that made me say ""Yep, this is how awkward teenagers act"" throughout the movie. Gyllenhall's Mysterio is fun, but I would have loved to have seen him play a hero because I feel he exudes the charisma of a superhero. The mid-credit scene is a real treat for those OG Spider-Man fans with the return of J.J. Jameson. The low points of this movie are the CGI and casting of May Parker. The CGI can be great in some areas and very poor in others. Also, I kind of understand why Marvel decided to cast someone young to play May, but it's still weird. May has always been this fragile woman who has guided Peter's desire to protect the weak. But in this version, she is hooking up with Happy, so it feels a bit out of character compared to previous versions of May. I do like that Peter's identity was revealed to her after the first movie. Something about that just makes it feel like he has a partner to help him. Overall, fantastic movie. I will definitely watch this one again.",26-Mar-22,2.5,0.065,0.686,0.249,0.9971,,,,,,

Matthew C,"(VERY CLOSE TOO SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING) In Spider-man Far from home, there are a lot more funny scenes and great laughs, along with even more action packed scenes. It's just as good as Spider-man homecoming. The ending took me by complete shock, but in a great way. Tom Holland and Zendaya's performances are great and they are on top of their game as actors in this movie. Superhero fans will love this movie just as much as they've loved the Spider-Man Homecoming movie. With both of the two movies combined I definetely want too see Spider-Man: No Way Home. These are the kind of movies that are worth seeing in the movie theaters, and if Tom Holland and Zendaya ever do another Spider-Man movie, I will be seeing it in the movie theater. I'm very impressed by what they did. This time around the story was just as good and that's why I give it an amazing star rating. I love the glasses that Tom Holland gets as Peter Parker/Spider-man and everyone did a great job with the bus scene, when they drive too Prog, that scene is funny and filled with action.

Sofy R,The second of the Tom Holland led Spider-Man series is probably my least favourite out of all the Spider-Man movies.

Jake R,"In terms of marvel movies out there, this film is pretty run of the mill. Mysterio and his motives are not super captivating, the plot is fairly straightforward, the humor is there but isn't strong enough to carry the film. We didn't get enough screen-time of Ned and JB Smoove (The King Baby), but Happy was great and he shone well in the scenes he was featured in. Honestly the best part of the film is the cliffhanger at the end, it really feels like this film is setting the stage for the sequel rather then standing firmly on its own merits. If you are already committed to the marvel universe it's a good watch, but if you just wanted a one off superhero movie there are better movies out there, even just among other marvel films.",29-Jan-22,5,0.033,0.708,0.259,0.991,,,,,,

Emmanuel L,"50% Romantic Comedy, 50% Action Short Synopsis: Plot very similar to Home Coming but in Europe, the writers did not think of a new story. The movie makes no sense since it doesn't explain why if there were hundreds of super heroes in End Game, now it turns out that there is only Spidey? isn't Stark more likely to inherit his glasses from Pepper Pots than Peter? Why can't Peter take a phone from his partner with just his spider powers? didn't Mystery have to give permission for Peter to wear the glasses? It is worth highlighting the visual effects, unlike the cartoon here they explain Mystery's powers very well, and the illusions he uses are amazing, I think Sony is managing to turn pathetic villains into imposing villains. The end of the movie is pure Spiderman-style action, meaning he pushes himself to the limit to save the world. At least I did find a moral to this movie and that is, if you make a big mistake in your life, you correct it based on courage and effort. I give this movie a 5/10 rating, if you expect a Sam Raimi-style work of art then don't watch it, but if you expect one more episode of spidey without logic similar to cartoons then go see it.",19-Jan-22,5,0.098,0.768,0.134,0.8338,,,,,,
Random A,"Spider-Man: Far From Home, the awkward end of Phase 3 of the MCU, is a complete waste of time. It barely has any character development in it and the story focuses too much on the school trip than actually showing Peter cope with the loss of Tony Stark, his father figure. The first two-thirds of the movie was dull and did not contribute anything to the overall story, and therefore completely skippable, and the final battle surprisingly bored me even more than the other CGI final battles in the MCU. However, I will say that Mysterio is a fantastic twist villain, however the movie does not give him enough screen time as a villain as the first two-thirds focused too much on taking down the fake Elementals. This movie has extremely bad humour and some very annoying characters; the tone is lighthearted while not having any tension or stakes. The sole purpose of this movie is for Spider-Man's identity to be revealed, which only happens in a mid-credits scene. If you like watching a romantic teenage comedy with Spider-Man shoved in it somewhere, then you will enjoy this movie. However, if you are expecting a movie focusing on Peter Parker and how he copes with losing his mentor and father figure, then this movie is total garbage.",18-Jan-22,5,0.146,0.745,0.11,-0.8379,,,,,,

Rich R,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great follow-up to the successful first MCU Spider-Man solo movie. Just like before, it showcases one of Spider-Man's most popular villains. Jake Gyllenhaal acting was perfect, thanks to being a seasoned actor. Excellent special effects highlighted Mysterio's powers. The twist and turns were somewhat predictable but still highly entertaining. Tom Holland once again owned the beloved iconic character. This light, cheerful and fun atmosphere is best suited for Spider-Man movies, instead of the usual dark and gritty approach of some movies in the genre. The European setting was a marketing gimmick, but it worked. Zendaya is pretty and charming, but I don't really see her as Mary Jane. But that's just me. Jason Batalon is still funny as always, providing the humor. Great direction, pacing, special effects and script. Solid, fun and entertaining!

Matthew D,"A thoroughly enjoyable Spider-Man trip. Director Jon Watts' superhero coming of age adventure Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) is a pleasant improvement over the fun times from Homecoming. Watts' direction takes up an ultra fast pacing for 129 minutes that feels like 45 to me. Producer Kevin Feige clearly trusted Watts to deliver after his delightful Homecoming showing with funny jokes and a frenetic modern style. Watts brings Mysterio to life with really creative magician's illusions for surreal imagery and exhilarating action that keeps you guessing. I love Mysterio and it was thrilling to never guess the twists and figure out what is real. Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wonderfully develop Peter Parker and Michelle Jones' romance drama with earnest feelings and cute teenage awkwardness. I love McKenna and Sommers' goofy humor that incorporates contemporary zoomer slang that kids will get and laugh at alongside their parents. The way they develop Peter Parker's serious dramatic mourning over Tony Stark's sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame. Tom Holland portrays Peter Parker with that charming teenage awkwardness, while also drawing upon his inner feelings over Robert Downey Jr.'s departure from The MCU and Iron Man's death. You believe Holland's Peter Parker is conflicted over being the superhero Spider-Man and just trying to have fun on his class science trip to Europe. I find his romantic chemistry with Zendaya very sweet as they're cute together. Zendaya is quite funny as MJ with her signature morbid humor and stunning stunning. I hope they develop Peter Parker and MJ's relationship more in No Way Home. I'm left intrigued for No Way Home after the hilarious reveal in Far From Home's after credits scene that must be seen. Spider-Man: Far From Home is a real blast. Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Nick Fury is very funny as his harsh words of dire encouragement and obvious frustrations with Spider-Man ghosting his phone calls. The tranquilizer scene is super funny. Jake Gyllenhaal is the reason to see Far From Home as Quentin Beck and Mysterio. Gyllenhaal draws upon his neurotic Nightcrawler character with his media obsession and totalitarian control regardless of the human cost as the manipulative Mysterio. I love how genuine, kind, patient, and paternal Gyllenhaal is with Tom Holland's Peter Parker. He completely feels like a motivated egomaniac as Gyllenhaal kills it as his illusory sociopath Beck. Mysterio is one of Spider-Man's villains and Jake Gyllenhaal lives up to the fishbowl helmeted antagonist with style. Mysterio is a top tier Marvel villain in The MCU. Marisa Tomei's Aunt May is so gorgeous and flirty. She's very protective and motherly with Tom Holland. Her dating scenes with Jon Favreau are so charming. I found Jon Favreau hilarious as Happy Hogan. His genuine advice and support to Peter Parker is legit moving as he simultaneously mourns Tony Stark's Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal as Tony Stark. Favreau gave us Iron Man and continues to delight in The MCU as Happy. Jacob Batalon's Ned is always quaint and likable as Peter Parker's dorky best friend. Tony Revolori is more likable as Peter's bully Flash, who now likes Spider-Man. Angourie Rice is truly hilarious with her deadpan delivery as the adorable Betty Brant. Her disgust at nerd culture is fun as well as her obnoxious flirting with Ned is fun. Remy Hii's third wheel love interest for MJ named Brad is a neat jerk for Peter Parker to contend with in Far From Home. Martin Starr is too funny as Peter Parker's worried teacher Mr. Harrington. J.B. Smoove is also funny as the paranoid teacher Mr. Dell. Cobie Smulders is lovely and cool as Maria Hill with more of a commanding presence than ever. I'm glad her role in The MCU is expanding. Editors Dan Lebental and Leigh Folsom Boyd impress with their fast cuts for Mysterio's sudden appearances and illusions. Cinematographer Matthew J. Lloyd loves these nice medium and wide shots that have steadfast focus and nice perspectives. Interesting how few close-ups Lloyd uses unless it's for the serious, heartfelt moments. Claude Paré's production design uses Venice, Prague, and London's natural scenery and creates lavish sets for the kids to travel. The innovative art direction and visual effects for Mysterio is groundbreaking with how inventive his magic powers look to not appear as illusions. Composer Michael Giacchino's score is exciting and funny, really matching Far From Home's tones. Anna B. Sheppard's Mysterio costume design is so cool to see on the silver screen. In all, Spider-Man: Far From Home is really entertaining, well made, and creatively made with a lot of heart. I enjoyed Far From Home as much as Homecoming, if not more.",5-Jan-22,3.5,0.082,0.653,0.266,0.9995,,,,,,

Hassan I,"Jon Watts' ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is action-packed, heartwarming and wildly entertaining sequel that proves the web-slinging hero hasn't lost his ability to marvel movie-goers despite Oscorp-orate studio rivalries. With second Spider-Man feature, Watts expands the web-slinging superhero's world through rich identity self-discovery. Through spellbinding cinematography, Watts immerses viewers into the s-Parker-ling hero's journey to confront Mysterio-us adversary on vacation to Italy. Watts' decision to shoot Spider-Man's action using aerial sequences above ground works immensely. Inspired by Sam Raimi's trilogy, Watts effectively employs aerial shots to showcase Spider-Man's newfound affection toward his superpowers. Watts showcases extraordinary control over action sequences, editing and musical score, weaving spectacular cinematic spin-off. It's hard to not marvel at Marvel-ous cast performances. Tom Holland delivers one of the finest performances of career as the web-slinging superhero. With mesmerizing expression, he signals adolescent angst, desperation and resentment of the high-school confronting alter-ego identity on a Mysterio-us trip to Italy. Zendaya is equally extraordinary in role of Mary-Jane-lized heroine that risks his own safety to keep boyfriend's identity secret. If previous iterations of Mary Jane portrayed her as damsel in distress, Zendaya brings female empowerment to character through strong demeanor. The final, most unforgettable standout is Jake Gyllenhaal. As the menacing villain Mysterio, he imbues shades of humanity into a multi-layered villain. Although ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is must-see for Spidey fans, ultimately it isn't flawless. It's goofy humor is slightly needless, more suited towards high-school specials rather than serious comic-book movies. Moreover, it builds to cliffhanger ending without satisfying resolution. Nonetheless, fans of the web-slinging hero will definitely enjoy ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. In an era of superhero fatigue, it's web-slinging sign Marvel's most friendly neighbor hasn't lost his abilities to marvel movie-goers through s-Parker-ling powers rather than his petered out exposure on world wide web despite Mysterio-us adversaries claiming it may be time for hero to hang up his suit and tie by publicly revealing identities to Oscorp-orate companies torn apart by Battle-Garfield rivalries Mag-acquired across centuries.",4-Jan-22,3.5,0.104,0.738,0.158,0.9778,,,,,,

I don't at all get the relationship of the two friends (I guess it was for humour, but really wasn't, and really wasn't necessary), nor why the competition for the girl just suddenly disappeared (if he was honestly interested, he would have let go so easily).

Tying all of the series into this and then bringing in Matt Murdock, and even the Venom-verse… I can only hope Marvel gives the fans what they want and not what they think we need… no more ""woke"" crap… give us the source!",31-Dec-21,1.5,0.049,0.802,0.148,0.9039,,,,,,
Jack-Henry K,"Not the best Spider-Man movie by a long shot, but this movie had everything I wanted and more. It also really made me appreciate the Andrew Garfield movies a lot more. This film got more right than the last two movies before it. The action was great, each character's arc felt justified, apart from some villains, and it wasn't overly reliant on references. Worth a re-watch. (I realize as I post this review, I posted it on the wrong Spider-Man movie.

Mahera A,"Not sure why the audience reviews are so bad- most seem to have some other agenda rather than actually thinking the film was bad. As for me, I began this movie with low expectations, prepared for a very woke/feminist trashy plot with all the focus being on 'oh my god its a girl wow' and not much relevance to the MCU, I did NOT expect to be invested in the film at all. What I got was a plot that was actually almost an origin story for the MCU, with a healthy amount of girl power that was pleasant and not rubbed in the face, and quite a decent storyline with some cool action scenes and good humour. It's not the best film I've seen- the plot was a bit predictable in places and the after a certain point the villains didn't seem dangerous enough for the plot to feel threatened by them- but nonetheless I enjoyed seeing a less serious (and two-eyed!) version of Nick Fury and overall this film far exceeded my expectations; I enjoyed it more than I thought it would and certainly far more than reviewers who let some outside source affect their experience. Goose the cat/Flerken is the best character IMO. I'd recommend you watch it but please don't let some internet feud spoil it for you. Enjoy!",20-Feb-22,0.5,0.115,0.721,0.164,0.8845,,,,,,

This movie is riddled with glaring, plot holes and mediocre, lazy writing that often ignores, negates, and/or renders nonsensical, several elements previously established in the MCU. The development of the main character seemed rushed and is so shallow, one dimensional and forced, that it almost seems as if the message they were trying to convey was more important to them than the story itself or creating a complex, well rounded character, that is intended (I assume) to be a cornerstone in the next phase of the MCU.",18-Feb-22,0.5,0.076,0.771,0.152,0.7805,,,,,,

The story is formulaic, but there is a plot twist that makes it more interesting. I love how the Kree and the Skrulls were designed and represented. I just don't agree with one of the casting choices. Humor is alright, but some lines and situations were too cheesy. The cat named Goose stole the show by being both adorable and badass. Carol Danver's origin was well told and presented. It was great to see young Monica Rambeau. I hope we get to see more of her in the future. My expectation for this movie was rather high, and I was hoping for more depth and substance, but I was still entertained, nonetheless.

The writing on itself doesn't feel bad, but the way the story is told is just awful, besides we don't get nothing new in here, just a generic story of good triumphing against evil with a very generic and underdevelop villain.

Luckily for the film though all the other characters around Carol keep this movie afloat, and are the best parts of this movie, especially the main villain Talos.

Michael D,"First the good stuff: 1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much ""agent coulson prior avengers"" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen. 2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos! 3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while. 4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very good the bad: 1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie. 2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; ""but you didnt deserve that yet..."" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way) 3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed. All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable. I's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers.

I do not like Mary Sue's who stand above men like some sort of super human. This movie is flash but has nothing more going for it.

I don't know if this was Larson's interpretation of the character or some really inept direction, but her character was totally unlikable and unrelatable to a degree I've never seen in a Marvel movie.

I wouldn't say there wasn't any betrayal, etc … but you simply don't see anything beyond Carol beating them up … I mean you don't feel she felt anything …. I mean say contrast it to another Marvel scene … Loki yelling at Odin ""Tell me!"" Tony telling cap ""I thought I was your friend"" It doesn't require more screen time but the audience felt that. Maybe the it's the director, maybe it's the lead actor but the movie despite its great effects and fight scene was just dry and unmemorable.

Jacob S,"Like the very much anti-imperialist slant Iron Man is somewhat going for, but I do find it a bit confused. Tony Stark realizing his weapons are just propagating the terrorism from home and how the US generates the war effort from weapon manufacturers, but it still has a messy lens from Bush-era politics of intervening still because ""it's personal"", where it seeps in somewhat as a creator mad at its misuse because it's on his conscience (Gulmira is a personal attachment from Yinsen and his weapons are still being misused), rather than a climb to sanity towards the tools of destruction, although it does go a few steps forwards on this, and it's one person rather than the military. Still an imperialist justification innit? I like how Stark is confronted character wise on his arrogance, but it doesn't get rid of his smarminess and it makes him mostly unlikable for me even with scenes with Pepper that are heartfelt. At least he's called out for it, dumbly trying to right himself and the film exposits it as a messy road with consequences despite his well-intentions (he almost gives Obadiah tools of even bigger destruction if he wasn't there to intervene in the end). Pepper really showcasing the weird, awkward, and slightly yikes power gap in the relationship of an employer and their employee. I get that the movie lampshades this by having Pepper literally point it out, even trying to close the power gap a bit with how he ""wouldn't even be able to tie his shoes"" without her, giving her quitting more possible weight to the other firing her, but it's still weird! The few soundtrack choices are excellent (Suicidal Tendencies... perfection), but the score itself is weak as hell. I don't know a single musical score for a film from Ramin Djawadi that was ever any good, the closest being Pacific Rim and that wasn't even all him (Tom Morello helped out on a few notable songs)! Only good stuff is for TV a la Prison Break, Game of Thrones, or Westworld, and the last one is mostly orchestral covers even if they're used well. Maybe it's because he doesn't put up much of a fight with directors like Favreau when it comes to temp tracks in film? Not sure. Still very weak, impossible to note. Even for the scenes' use it's very disappointing, barely adding anything save for the strings coming through in the mix at very predictable times for something ""epic"". It's so nice to see a film that isn't grey as fuck color grading, but also the nighttime itself isn't that pretty. I don't need CG lens flares but it's too muted for the most part. There are pretty shots like the ""Jericho"" presentation and Iron Man falling down from a tank shot, and the IMAX Enhanced version does add a bit more depth to some shots like the mountains. Not that huge of an improvement, but noticeable! CG is also great for the most part save for some spotty parts in the end (bobbing head with Obadiah), but the Iron Man suit... master class. I think the film is mostly well shot for action pieces, but other than the last fight and the mass explosions of the weapons at the end of the first act, I wasn't super impressed. Felt like the action was just underbaked in terms of how it's showcased and written, or maybe my bar is too high. It's neat though to see gadget-y things like the targeting in the hostage situation. At least it's not CUT CUT CUT. For a film that's clearly trying to stay away from an R rating, laughing really hard at the... ""interesting"" POV from the bus in the last fight to look visually stimulating. Iron Man gets hit into the bus, and the cut into the view from the bus gives visual information that somebody is looking outside AT him, implying there are people in there... and then the bus is blown up with no bodies. The explanation comes earlier, there's a scene with people mass evacuating from the bus, but I think it's interesting visual confusion. Top tier performance from Jeff Bridges. The meme of a box of scraps is probably because it's such a killer performance of the line. I also like RDJ, Paltrow, and Howard, really funny in particular to hear Howard say ""humanitarian"" so loudly, a parallel to Bridges calling the peaceful people ""hippies"", performances really hammering in that point. Bridges is so good in a villainous role. Breath of fresh air to have a MCU film that isn't wall to wall in quips. My sister pointed out that the quips are mostly from RDJ, while the rest are mostly visual gags like harsh cuts, which is my fav humor in the film tbh. I love the setup-punchline of it (""No I won't be drinking...."" 1 harsh cut later and he's completely drunk), wonder if that's what Favreau is known for. The quips are also characterized, where RDJ is more of reactionary quipping as he's clearly not in full control ever (constantly missing timelines, emotionally wrecked internally, etc.). I don't think quips on their own are bad. Think facing adversity with humor is just a very human thing in general (a la Rhodes with ""how was the Fun-vee?""), but I also think it's better that it's rare instead of all the time. Frankly would've edited that entire scene of Iron Man saving the military guy with his parachute out of the film. It's tonally confused in the concept of him trying to run away from the military/going rogue by himself, and it barely gets any weight so the payoff is worthless. I'm totally up for superheroes saving the common guy, there's a funny moment after saving the people in Gulmira with leaving the person responsible for gunning them up without his gun, in the middle of a crowd that's absolutely going to do some avenging (hehe), but you can't make the military trying to shoot him and then ""help save me"" the next second. To sum it up, messy anti-imperialism theming but mostly decent film with a good character direction for Tony Stark.

Kyle E,"When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox",24-Feb-22,4.5,0.057,0.728,0.215,0.9954,,,,,,

Gage W,"I wouldn't call it a ""kick-off"" to the MCU, because it feels so different and separated from the other MCU movies, but perhaps that is it's greatest strength.

Jake B,"Iron Man (A) The blend of funny moments, action, and just unbridled fun that we know and love the MCU for was started here. At the time this was very refreshing and I remember being a child and watching this and being amazed by how much it felt authentic to the feeling of a comic book. Upon rewatching and with the rest of the MCu in mind this movie really still holds up. It is a great example of a solid self contained superhero movie that knows what it wants to do and executes it perfectly. Robert Downey Jr. is the absolute perfect casting choice for Tony Stark and Iron Monger played by Jeff Bridges makes for a really compelling villian. This movie does such an amazing job of making you feel the tone that was intended. The action scenes are heavily animated but somehow still feel grounded. The sounds of iron man's armor taking shots, the brutal was of the first 20 minutes as we see iron Man and his ascension, the chemistry between Tony and Pepper (wonderfully played by Gwyneth Paltrow... So many aspects blend together very well and the twists end up feeling like a gut punch. In some ways the independence and unreliance on cameos and Easter eggs makes this movie great and something I kind of want more from in the modern MCU. Don to get me wrong I love seeing superheroes team up and how everything is connected... It's fun. But I would love a few more self contained masterpieces like Iron Man to have in the mix. This film will always stand as one of the most influential and pivotal movies in the superhero genre. If not for some lazy writing near the end and a little too much reliance on cgi in the final battle this movie could have been perfect.",15-Feb-22,4.5,0.037,0.744,0.219,0.9959,,,,,,

Random A,"Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. premiere an emotional start to an era of Marvel movies. Jon Favreau ushered in a new era of superhero movies with his fantastic superhero sci-fi action adventure Iron Man (2008). He stylized Iron Man like it's a serious war drama with high stakes and character driven stories. Favreau took the often forgotten and maligned Marvel superhero Iron Man and made him into a household name and beloved pop culture figure. Favreau approaches Tony Stark's character as a complex character with a transcendent character arc with a sympathetic perspective into a boozehound billionaire and scientific genius you believe would want to get into a metallic suit and shoot arc reactor beams at villains. Iron Man instantly became my favorite Marvel superhero after Favreau's first Iron Man movie as I'm sure he did for countless others. Iron Man was the blueprint, but Favreau perfected the model with his sterling archetype. Favreau's heartfelt direction allows you to see Tony Stark as a flawed man, yet a deserving hero. Writers Art Marcum, Matt Holloway, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby bring Tony Stark to life for the silver screen with his flippant sarcasm, constant insincerity, war profiteering, and depressive alcoholism despite his good nature and selfless heroism. In fact, Favreau demonstrates how Stark's choice to become Iron Man is anything but selfless as Tony wants to give back to a world he set on fire through his Stark family missiles. Favreau's direction for Iron Man is serious and enthralling. Jon Favreau's direction is so good that he redeems a war profiteering weapons salesman. I love Iron Man with a singular passion. I honestly think Iron Man is Marvel's best movie in their MCU as well as Jon Favreau's finest film as director with a real vision. Robert Downey Jr.'s career is rescued as Jon Favreau casts this fallen star at his lowest point. I appreciate Favreau changing Robert Downey Jr.'s life around and giving him another chance as he is capable of greatness like Chaplin, Zodiac, Iron Man, and both Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. is so charismatic, hilarious, charming, inspiring, and cool as Tony Stark and his superhero persona Iron Man that you will love the guy by the end of Favreau's film. Robert Downey Jr. and Iron Man are now household names because of this phenomenal film and brilliant performance from a master artist firing on all cylinders. You believe Tony Stark wants a paradigm shift in his love to earn his dead father's respect, while rekindling the love he has for Pepper Potts. Iron Man is certainly an emotional journey into self-discovery and personal recovery that launches Marvel's Cinematic Universe of superhero movies for decades to come. Gwyneth Paltrow is so gorgeous as a redhead and really sweet as Tony Stark's love interest Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Paltrow's deadpan sarcasm is really funny and her tender flirting is subtle and sincere. You see her emotion in the tears in her eyes when Tony comes back from being held captive. She's very endearing and a key part of why Robert Downey Jr. is so likable as Tony Stark because of their romantic chemistry and compatible personalities. I honestly wish Marvel had focused more on Pepper Potts' relationship with Tony Stark in the later Iron Man and Avengers movies. Leslie Bibb is pretty and snarky as Vanity Fair reporter Christine Everhart. Costume designers Laura Jean Shannon and Rebecca Gregg design slick pinstripe suits for Tony Stark, wicked Iron Man concepts, and sultry blouses, skirts, and dresses for Pepper Potts. Gwyneth Paltrow has never looked better than in Pepper Pott's navy blue backless dress at the Stark party dance scene. I love the layered, sleek chrome armor for Iron Man's suits, especially with all the intricate moving gears and wires underneath. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the often pleasant Obadiah Stane, then suddenly ominous and intimidating. His scene dancing around the truth in Tony's Stark office with Pepper is actually tense and frightening. He was an interesting villain with a for profit motive that makes sense as he doesn't care about casualties, only stock value. Once Bridges is playing Iron Monger, then the fight is quite intense. Terrence Howard was actually good here as Rhodey as he plays a solid foil to Stark's fooling around. His military presence is always a reminder that The United States Federal Government and the U.S. Army just wants Stark for his killing machines. I enjoy Paul Bettany's pleasant voice as Tony Stark's robotic butler J.A.R.V.I.S. Jon Favreau's cameo as Harold ""Happy"" Hogan is the start of his wonderful and funny screen presence alongside Iron Man. Shaun Toub is phenomenal as Yinsen in the cave as his moral guidance and serious tone give Iron Man a gravitas and motivation like few heroes get as emotionally. Clark Gregg gets introduced as the likable S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson here. Peter Billingsley from A Christmas Story cameos as the scientist William Ginter Riva, who cannot figure out Tony Stark's arc reactor technology. Stan Lee's cameo got a laugh out of me alongside all his model dates. Samuel L. Jackson's first appearance as Nick Fury in Iron Man's after credits scene is a fun introduction to his stern style. I'm glad Marvel's producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige had the foresight to plan the MCU ahead and the decency to allow Jon Favreau to complete his unique directorial vision for Iron Man. Editor Dan Lebental cuts swiftly for a fast paced 126 minutes. Eventually, Iron Man became the formula for how Marvel cuts their movies together, but rarely do they feel as polished and sharp with their transitions and sequencing. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique came up with several iconic wide shots like Tony demoing his Jericho missile exploding in the background. I love Iron Man shooting a rocket at a tank and turning around as it shows you he's had enough of this situation. The close-up shots are really effective like the targeting bullets to not hit hostages that looks like a Western quick draw scene. Libatique's close-up shots are often emotional as Robert Downey Jr. captures Tony's sentiments with his tearful eyes, serious tone, and expressive facial acting. Production designer J. Michael Riva's sets for Tony Stark's home and business are really cool. You always feel like Stark's mansion is the coolest place on Earth. J. Michael Riva's art direction, interior spaces, and real props for the suit and parts look amazing still. How did they get the practical effects so realistic and the CGI looking so real back in 2008 and yet modern Marvel movies have awful, fake, and ugly CGI? Visual effects artists Hal T Hickel, Andy Hass, and Ben Snow lead an impressive CGI team that merges the real and the fantasy with subtle uses of green screen mixed in with the prop work here. Composer Ramin Djawadi creates a thrilling atmosphere and moving emotions with his magnificent score for Iron Man that combines softer classical pieces with fresh rock instrumentation. I adore Jon Favreau's choice of AC/DC, Suicidal Tendencies, and of course Black Sabbath songs throughout Iron Man. I wish Marvel experimented more with their soundtracks like Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy did. Sound designers Christopher Boyes and Frank E. Eulner makes every thruster and arc beam blast sound enormous. In conclusion, I love Iron Man and Jon Favreau's first picture with Robert Downey Jr. will always remain my favorite Marvel movie.",22-Jan-22,5,0.096,0.677,0.227,0.9997,,,,,,
Thapelo M,"Iron Man is a decent first instalment to start off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has its flaws, but it is nonetheless an entertaining and fun experience. Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., has a very distinct and enjoyable personality, and goes through a rich character arc throughout this movie; from being a billionaire playboy who sells military weapons to one who has compassion for others. The first two-thirds of the movie are refreshing as we follow Tony Stark evolve and become a better person. However, the final act brings the movie down for me. Obadiah Stane was a cunning and menacing villain in the first half of the movie, but after he dons the Iron Monger suit his character falls apart and he just devolves into a generic evil person with unclear motives and the same powers as the protagonist. Other than that, I felt that the final scene was a nice twist on te traditional superhero stereotype that heroes must never reveal their identity. Overall, it is a solid and decent first instalment of the franchise but could be better.",19-Jan-22,5,0.092,0.716,0.192,0.9719,,,,,,

Yeah so I need to watch the first two to complete the list. Man this movie was a blast. This movie was where RDJ was at his best with being Tony Stark. He embraced the cocky personality beautifully and was charismatic throughout. He was just incredible. My absolute favorite scene was when Tony toyed with the Iron suit. That was so fun and real. It definitely felt like someone playing out his new toy. Of course RDJ with his charisma made the scene so hilarious. The character of Tony Stark was pretty good also. It's about redemption and find out his greater purpose. It also felt more in depth, not surface level like Shang-chi. Also his romance with Pepper was pretty sweet and want too rushed. Some of the problem was just the basic and predictable villain, who was actually played nicely by Jeff Bridges.

Nathan D,"Iron Man is a fun film and has a lot of pleasurable aspects to it. The stand-out feature of the film has to be Jon Favreau's directing. Favreau knocked it out of the park with this film as he made the film feel real yet still out of the box with some rather satisfying creative elements. Favreau knows how to create scenes where certain emotions can be easily pulled out of the audience. There are multiple scenes in the film where you feel fear, disgust, happiness, and so much more. The film feels immersive and fun while still having these darker tones that add some dynamics to the film. The script is also solid, but there are some tiny nitpicks I have. The main nitpick I have is that the second act goes on for too long. Most of the 2nd act felt basic and stretched out. This leads the film to lose its momentum a bit. It also took Tony Stark way too long to become Iron Man. For Tony to become Iron Man over an hour after the film has started is just not right. It clearly shows that the second act goes on way too long. I would have loved to have learned more about the suit instead of solely focusing on the business aspect of the situation. Yes, the business aspect of the film is very crucial to the story, but it is also the story of Iron Man. To have more information about the suit and how it works would have improved the film. However, there was a good balance between action and storytelling. Plus, the action sequences are well-choreographed and have some visually pleasing scenes. The cinematographer in the film was marvelous as the lighting was spot on in every scene. Cinematography Matthew Libatique knows how to craft the perfect style of shot for every scene. Libatique also did an amazing job at having the red and yellow colors on the suit blend in with the surrounding area while still making it pop. It is a hard thing to do, yet Libatique pulled it off. The score from composer Ramin Djawadi is also very nicely done as the rock vibe made a vast impact on the film. As for the cast, almost everyone did a great job. Robert Downey Jr. was phenomenal as Tony Stark. Downey nailed down the ""likable yet annoying"" aspect flawlessly. Terrence Howard is also pretty solid, yet his line delivery is far from perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow was someone I didn't like in this film. Paltrow can't act in this film with most of her line delivery coming off as annoying and careless. Paltrow didn't convince me that Pepper was into Tony at all. To round out the cast, Jeff Bridges did a wonderful job, and he was a great villain that stood out. Overall, Iron Man is such an entertaining film with some outstanding aspects to it. Jon Favreau does a phenomenal job in the director's chair, and Matthew Libatique nails down the cinematography. Yes, there are some minor script problems, but actors like Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges do a great job hiding them as they make the movie what it is.

Stephy S,"The start of a new era in cinema, Iron Man wasn't just revolutionary in the super hero genre, it was a revolution in cinema as a whole that lead to the billion dollar franchise we now all know and love. It wasn't just a trend setter however, it was a full blown work of art, with a character arc that rivals even the greatest, the comedic genius of Robert Downey Jr and Jon Favreau, fast paced, quirky action sequences and some redefining CGI for its time. Yet, it still had to get its feet wet being the first, the villain is as generic as it gets, outside of our lead, the cast isn't all too fleshed out and some of the CGI in the later half of the movie can feel out of place. Yet, it can all be excused by the overwhelming amount of positive stuff in here, Iron Man is still a peak in MCU history with not many having been able to supersede it.

Becky G,"I'm not much of a fan of Tony Stark as a character, but this is still a solid movie. The story is great - it's engaging and interesting, and actually tackles some really good themes. The villain is a bit disappointing, being a pretty typical superhero villain out for power and money. And of course he has to put on his own Iron Man suit so we can have a classic ""good Iron Man vs. bad Iron Man"" scene. The thing that really prevents my full enjoyment of the movie is how his relationship with Pepper is portrayed. It is possible that I am ""overly sensitive to this sort of thing. However – I think they are going for the ""cute always bickering couple who finally realizes their feelings for each other"" vibe. And portraying that sort of relationship in this way can be really dangerous. The whole boss/employee dynamic made me a bit uncomfortable. Knowing that she's around Tony all the time and falls for him despite the fact that he does not treat her well actually felt a little Stockholm Syndrome to me. I know some might think this is extreme, but as a woman who has had past relationships where I felt treated like that and it was not healthy at all, I have a hard time being on board.",4-Aug-21,4,0.143,0.689,0.168,0.8226,,,,,,

Mckein H,"What a hell of a way to kick off the character of Tony Stark aka Iron-Man as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, little did we know it at the time of this movie's release but it had quite a big burden riding on its success. RDJ was born to play this part, I mean that's just how perfect he fits and plays the character of Tony Stark aka Iron-Man, giving one of the most personal performances of his career I'd imagine, considering just how perfectly he fills out the character. Jon Favreau showed his talents as an action movie director in this career-launching of a movie for both Favreau and RDJ, this was the perfect summer action movie blockbuster with a well-written lead character and an action-packed story from literal start to finish. Now, the villain isn't very fleshed out in regards to his motives or of switching sides, Jeff Bridges gives a competent performance as Obadiah Stane but he definitely doesn't come to life like RDJ's performance as Iron-Man but still not a bad performance in any regard. This is a must-watch for any Marvel, Iron-Man, MCU, or action movie fans alike, so if for some reason you've been living under a rock for the last 13 years and you have yet to watch the 24 film entry franchise launching of a movie, then I strongly recommend you go out and find yourself a copy of this high octane, action-packed, and career re-starting movie and enjoy yourself.",29-Jul-21,4,0.041,0.739,0.22,0.9949,,,,,,
Sean L,"A jaded, egotistical, charismatic playboy weapons manufacturer is forced to take a close look at the human toll charged by his product and undergoes a morality crisis. As a means of getting through that, and making amends for his contributions to the military-industrial complex, he develops a succession of swanky, flying, armored suits and blows stuff up. I'm being a little snarky here, because the plot does an admirable job of cartwheeling through the various explanations and motives behind that transition and it's never quite so simple as ""bad guys can get rockets so I built a special rocket with racing strips that only I can control."" And even if it were, isn't that a perfect encapsulation of the public attitude taken by most media-friendly billionaires? Jon Favreau does a tremendous job in the director's chair, establishing the tone and character of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe in one clean, tight swoop. There's a lot of dangerous territory to tread here, iffy moments that could've easily fallen on the wrong side of the cornball, but Favreau manages to get through each one without losing credibility or thumbing his nose at the spirit of the source material. That's a whole lot easier said than done. Still, I'm not sure this ship could've stayed afloat without Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. He is the wind in the MCU's sails, a picture-perfect casting who dominates the screen every time he's near it. As a personality-driven action movie, that kind of presence is crucial. His balance of smug arrogance, cynical humor, intense determination and technological brilliance is just right, a wonderfully complex, fascinating turn which reveals different facets in every new light. No wonder they built a trillion-dollar franchise around this guy. His initial foil, a bald-and-bearded Jeff Bridges, is also very well developed and portrayed. I wish he'd stuck around for one or two sequels, because good villains would soon become a major weakness for this series and his character arc really splutters at the end.",27-Jul-21,4,0.123,0.728,0.149,0.8929,,,,,,

Luke J,"A well written action blockbuster coupled with great/good performances all around and a stellar lead. Robert Downey Junior was made for this role, truly embodying the escene of a pretentious, rash billionaire playboy. His mix of charisma and quick wit really allows him to craft a very likeable and engaging protagonist. So I heard there was no script for this movie recently and that really made me want to see how the art of improvising dialogue in cinema plays about. To my surprise, it worked pretty well. I mean this premise isn't too far fetched, making it a lot easier for the writing team to come up with cool and innovative explorations of the premise, but it's pretty well written for a well paced hero's journey. The structure of the movie is quite interesting, yes it does have all the Save the Cat moments, but opting for the hero to confront the tragedies of his business and forcing a change as early as Act 1 really started the film off on all cylinders. This change in ethos leads Tony to become active in the dealings of his business, encouraging him to shut down the weapon manufacturing arm of Stark Enterprises. I think the film crams this change into Act 1 to make way for the central romance and antagonist development in the second and third acts of the movie. I always say a hero is only as good as his villain and this perspective will always be the gold standard to making a phenomenal protagonist/antagonist, in my eyes at least. However this is where the movie falters. Although, Bridges provides an intimidating performance as the main antagonist, his true reason to hate Tony is very generic and could be built upon deeper. Yes, this could come at the expense of other aspects of the film, but allowing the audience to both understand and engage with the motivations of both the hero and the villain, allows for far more nail-biting and prolonged sequences of supense. It could be argued that the antagonist is active in his pursuit of dethroning Tony, hence continuously forcing the protagonist to adapt to a new scenario and making Bridges an incredibly sinister foe. However, he fails to actually push the protagonist to make any difficult decisions that requires the hero to contemplate on their initial perspective (The Dark Knight, Civil War, Man of Steel, Spiderman). Now I'm not against big bombastic CGI 3rd Act climaxes, but a good writer would know how to ground the hero/villain dynamic in adversarial philosophies that both ring true within the story world and can naturally develop within their respective characters. Iron Man's villain, although having a rich premise (with him being a friend and fellow board member with Howard and Tony Stark) fails to truly flesh the villain further opting for a more neat and clean cut approach to launch a vast cinematic universe. The romance plot was well executed, yet being quite by-the-book. Paltrow plays Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant and slowly builds a will-they-won't-they relationship throughout the film. Repeating my point from before, Downey's quick wit and charisma merged with Paltrow's tender portrayal adds to the verisimilitude of their relationship. This villain problem is a common mistake hindering further character development for a lot of these MCU heroes, bar Loki with Thor and Baron Zemo with Captain America. It doesn't really make the movies a waste of time, but they act as an anchor for most of these projects, blinding then from the true heights they can really reach. It follows the Blake Snyder beat sheet to the tee, but the combination of a strong romance plot, an active and funny protagonist and a super fantastical modern premise makes Iron Man one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I wish DC would have done this.",22-Jul-21,4,0.125,0.645,0.229,0.9977,,,,,,
Cailan D,"Iron Man was a phenomenal start to the MCU and today remains one of the most realistic films ever released by Marvel Studios. There is very little magical realism in the movie and the characters as well as how they progress and change through the film is all very believable. The acting, dialogue, story and directing are all fantastic and set the bar high for future Marvel installments to come. Iron Man is one of the highest rated movies in the whole universe, and is rightfully so; this is a movie that's not only really good but also has a lot of re-watch value to it, something that even great movies released recently don't have. Iron Man may have been released 13 years ago, but it remains an icon and a classic in its own right. If you want to watch a superhero origin movie that doesn't have an abundance of fancy special effects or a protagonist with amazing powers and abilities, Iron Man is a good bet for you.",18-Jul-21,4,0.028,0.824,0.147,0.9681,,,,,,

Jerry S,"Iron Man. THE FIRST MCU FILM It's crazy to me that it all started with this one film. First in foremost. I love this film, this movie is a fun thrill ride that really changed the way we see supper hero films. I never would have guessed that this movie would work. I never would've guessed we would've gotten an entire Cinematic Universe out of this. The film itself looks incredible despite of it being low budget and some of the VFX still hold up today. Iron Man as a character starts to grow on you from being shellfish and arrogant, to being less of that during his latter years. This film really set the stages of character development throughout the MCU. Now more than ever we are seeing the progression of these characters, from Iron Man, Cap, Thor, etc. this film just really wows me every time I go back and watch it. This whole entire Cinematic Universe started with this one film. A film that no one would thought would even work, or no one would even care about. But at the end of the day this movie started something that everyone said it's not going to work. But it did. And now it's the biggest thing since Star Wars. I have really that much respect with this film. Do I have problems with it? Yes. Not all of the VFX hold up well, and sometimes it does feel like some scenes could be cut to make it shorter but overall this movie is really good. It is a much watch.

Pedro R,"There may be those who agree with me, and those also who will disagree, but while it is not devoid of flaws I really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk, whereas I was disappointed in 2003's The Hulk, and I'm saying this as someone who loved Ang Lee's other films. If there is one thing that Lee's film succeeds better in, it is the visuals, don't get me wrong they are very stylish here but the ones in the 2003 film were slicker even if The Incredible Hulk is bigger and brasher. This said, the cinematography and editing are great and the locations and lighting look fantastic. The music rouses, the story compels most of the time and the dialogue provokes both in a thoughtful and emotional way. I do think that director Louis Letterier brings a lot of passion into the film, especially with the use of the form of street running called Parkour that he also used in The Transporter. The action sequences are suitably thumping, with efficient choreography and slick editing. The romantic elements are handled in a shrewd manner in alternative to the danger of slowing the film down, and thankfully there is no underdeveloped and convoluted subplot like Lee's film did with Nick Nolte. The first half though in a sense is better than the second. The second half is in no way bad, it's that the first half was very clever and compelling, and although you do identify with the titular character all the time and the finale is earth-shattering the film loses it a bit with the rather clichéd way the villain Blonsky is written and that his motives are not always very clear or as believable as they had potential to be. Casting-wise The Incredible Hulk is excellent. Edward Norton brims with intensity but he is also sympathetic. The Incredible Hulk also succeeds in making a real sense that Banner and the Hulk inhabit the same tortured mind, which made it much more accessible to identify with him, something that Lee's film did not do. William Hurt is appropriately steely as General Ross, Liv Tyler is attractive and the essence of sympathy as Banner's girlfriend and although his character is not as believable Tim Roth does somehow manage to bring some credibility to him. Overall, a very solid film, not perfect but better than the 2003 film by quite some distance. 8/10 Bethany Cox",17-Mar-22,3.5,0.088,0.708,0.204,0.9958,,,,,,

Alex W,I watched this last night as part of an MCU re-watch. This movie gets worse every time I see it honestly. Since it's an older film I'm just going to give a couple of points that I did not like. - Bad Acting/No Chemistry between Ed Norton and Liv Tyler - End Fight is a Massive CGI Mess - Eng Fight is Hulk Fighting Someone with the Same Powers - You can easily skip this movie and not miss any necessary information for the MCU - Some very slow and boring sections Rating - Awful,1-Mar-22,2.5,0.204,0.701,0.094,-0.8828,,,,,,

Pedro G,"Muy buena película, una cinta de superhéroes demasiado infravalorada en mi opinión. Lamentablemente esta película no tuvo las criticas esperadas, pero para mi es muy buena, llena de emoción, suspenso y la acción impactante. Esta película se inclina mas hacia una trama con acción y con un ritmo mas frenético, dejando de lado como se desarrollo la historia del personaje en la cinta del 2003. En cuanto al cast, para mi es perfecto, Edward Norton encaja perfectamente en el papel de Bruce Banner, sin duda alguna mejor que las otras versiones de Hulk y por lejos el mejor actor. El diseño de Hulk también me gusta mucho, a pesar de que en algunas escenas el CGI no esta tan bien hecho. A pesar de esto, creo que es el Hulk perfecto que se pudo ver en acción, super intimidante, fuerte y sin hacerse el cómico por momentos. En cuanto al villano final, no me termino de convencer principalmente su diseño, el cual me parece que no le queda nada bien y tampoco me gusta que este hablando en sus escenas. Por otro lado, además de Edward Norton, en las actuaciones también se destacan Liv Tyler, William Hurt y Tim Roth. En conclusión, me parece una película genial, la mejor que se hizo del personaje y es en esta donde se puede ver en mi opinión su mejor versión, acompañada de una trama muy entretenida llena de acción y suspenso.

Mateo L,"100% underrated film.True, it's far from being one of the best in the MCU, but let's face it, this movie is the one that has treated the Hulk character the best. Maybe in the part of Bruce Banner I do prefer Mark Ruffalo a bit, but this Hulk is superior to the soft green monster with baby complexes. And he's a thousand times superior to Professor Hulk from Endgame, really, in the movies it's better to have them separated.Here we are shown a Hulk to be afraid of (which is in itself the intention of a green monster as a hero), most of all in that final battle against Abomination and in every battle sequence against Ross and his army. This Hulk would have given Thanos a great fight and not freaked out in Infinity War just to give Bruce more of the spotlight.",27-Jan-22,2.5,0.091,0.736,0.174,0.9449,,,,,,
Matthew D,"The best movie ever made for Hulk honestly. Director Louis Leterrier's superhero sci-fi thriller The Incredible Hulk (2008) presents Bruce Banner as a desperate man and brilliant scientist. I like how nuanced Edward Norton is as Bruce Banner as you really feel how conflicted he is over using his enormous powers as Hulk without control. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige really let Leterrier go wild with stylish and intense direction that feels both grounded and gritty. The Incredible Hulk is certainly darker than other Marvel movies. The entire movie depicts Bruce as hurting, nervous, paranoid, angry, and sincere. Writer Zak Penn brings a humanity to his dialogue and thoughtful characterization of Bruce Banner and exciting action sequences for Hulk. Bruce feels like a real man figuring things out and having sensitive feelings. The Hulk kills it in the brutal hand to hand fight with Tim Roth's fearless super soldier Emil Blonsky. I appreciate Roth charging in and shooting erratically at Hulk, while the cool sonic wave guns blast at Hulk in the university grass. I don't like Abomination with his hideous design and ugly CGI, but the fight is brutal and engaging between him and Hulk. I just found Tim Roth more scary and interesting as a villain when he was a roided up human running and gunning at Hulk in broad daylight than in grimdark night as Abomination. I love Bruce talking to his scientist girlfriend, played by the ethereal beauty Liv Tyler with her sincere and sympathetic love interest Betty Ross. Liv Tyler has real chemistry with Edward Norton and you can tell they both actually tried to act out a genuine romance drama for their earnest storyline together. Her kindness, patience, and understanding is the perfect foil to William Hurt's raving General Ross with his disdain for decency and willingness to cross any ethical line for The United States Army. Ang Lee's Hulk movie is awful and confusing, if stylish. Mark Ruffalo's a pleasant Bruce Banner without the depth or the fierceness of Hulk. So honestly, The Incredible Hulk gives us the fearsome monstrous Hulk with the heartfelt Bruce Banner of Edward Norton. Marvel could never figure out what to do with the big green guy afterwards besides as a support character. To this day, Mark Ruffalo has yet to receive his own solo Hulk movie. I guess Edward Norton's Bruce Banner will always be excellent on his own strengths. Tim Blake Nelson's wily scientist is very fun and intriguing. I thought Ty Burrell added real heart to his shrink character in a rather humane moment. Lou Ferrigno's cameo is a cute nod to the original Hulk. Michael K. Williams has a quick cameo near the end and Stan Lee's cameo is actually hilarious as he guzzles down a gamma-ray radiated, green drink. Robert Downey Jr. has a charming and intriguing cameo to set up for Hulk joining The Avengers Initiative. Editors Rick Shaine, John Wright, and Vincent Tabaillon cut really rapidly in a jarring opening montage that tries to address Hulk's origins, but I wish they would have just added a true opening sequence to establish Bruce Banner even though Ang Lee's Hulk was just a few years earlier. Most of the rest of the movie cuts at a normal pace for a brisk 114 minutes. Cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. has plenty of excellent close-up shots and medium shots that look lovely. There are too many shaky camera scenes and goofy fast zooms to really age well, but The Incredible Hulk generally looks great. It's got a raw grit and darkly lit realism to it. Kirk M. Petruccelli's production design has realistic poor communities and science buildings, but the final fight set is awful with dull bricks and random fires everywhere. Art directors Andrew M. Stearn, Page Buckner, and Dan Dorrance came up with a less neon green Hulk, opting for a grittier and darker moss green that works well with this movie's moody color palette. Set decorator Carolyn A. Loucks adorns labs with tons of machines and equipment that you never question the realism of alongside the Hulk. Visual effects artists Betsy Paterson, Allan Magled, Kurt Williams, Julie D'Antoni, and Paul V. Molles did a solid job bringing a more grounded looking Hulk into Marvel's Cinematic Universe. The detail in their CGI is impressive and green colors look great. The Incredible Hulk's CGI still looks awesome, but Abomination looks dated and even uglier than when this was first released. Composer Craig Armstrong adds a haunting score and intense melodies to The Incredible Hulk that really works. I like the pulsing and thudding of Hulk's smashing and jumping. The sound design on the sonic waves is really neat alongside the rippling green Hulk flesh CGI. Denise Cronenberg and Renee Bravener's costumes look natural for our modern era and consider how to keep Bruce Banner's clothes on Hulk. Randy Westgate and Beate Petruccelli's make-up gives Edward Norton an intense look, Tim Roth a sweaty ferociousness, and Liv Tyler a lovely glow. In short, The Incredible Hulk is a great Marvel movie and strangely underrated now. You'd think Hulk fans would have appreciated Marvel actually giving Bruce Banner's character some respect with an interesting solo movie for once.",23-Jan-22,2.5,0.083,0.69,0.227,0.9994,,,,,,
Random A,"Many People have the opinion that Marvel's The Incredible Hulk is underrated. However, I disagree. This movie has no character development or personality traits for any of its characters. Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was just a normal guy in this movie; he has no personality or any character growth throughout this movie. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was absolute garbage; her acting was bland and emotionless to the point that it was jarring when she started shouting in one scene, albeit without reason. Emil Blonsky/The Abomination is a bland villain with almost no motivations and the generic trope of the villain having similar powers to the protagonist. However, I will say that Thunderbolt Ross had some character and was very well acted by William Hurt; I feel that he would have made a better main antagonist than Abomination. The story for this movie is boring and uninteresting, however it is still serviceable for a mediocre film. The CGI used in this movie is bafflingly bad, especially because Iron Man, a movie which was released before The Incredible Hulk, has much better CGI; that said, I understand that the Hulk is harder to animate than a metal suit. The score for the movie, composed by Craig Armstrong, is surprisingly good and much better than the generic modern Hans Zimmer style of movie soundtracks and I thoroughly enjoyed the music throughout the film.

On top of that a very average writing, all of those things make of this movie an easy forgettable experience. I still would love to see Marvel exploring more of Bruce Banner and The Hulk origins in a solo film, but since the rights are owned by Universal and this movie was a failure I don't think we'll be seeing anything like that any time soon.

With some pacing issues, and some inconsistencies there are plenty of parts of the movie that could be reworked. The acting is great though, and the action scenes do feel like they have some punch. While it is hard to hold it against this film, the hulk seems very slim compared to what we will come to see in future Marvel movies, so seeing this slimmer hulk was a bit odd, but nothing I could count against the movie as a whole as it works here. There isn't really anything that comes out of this movie except for Ross and Banner (who was recast following this film) so skipping it for End Game probably won't leave you missing out much.",16-Dec-21,2.5,0.053,0.855,0.092,0.7254,,,,,,

Puroo R,"After the release of Avengers: Infinity War everyone was getting hyped for Endgame. My board exams had just gotten over so I thought this was the perfect time to bingewatch all the MCU movies so that I could catch up by the time Endgame came up. The very first movie I watched was Iron Man and it was so cool. So I had really high hopes with The Incredible Hulk. And it fell absolutely flat. There are many reasons why I hate this movie, so I'm gonna go one by one through all the reasons. So first of all, since I was bingewatching all the movies of the greatest superhero movie franchise of all time, the only scenes that stood out for me were the absolutely fabulous ones. This is the reason why I'm easily able to judge which movies are memorable and which ones are not. This one had a very memorable starting, but afterwards nothing huge happens in it worth remembering. Stan Lee died because Hulk's blood fell in a bottle that he drank, some junkies in Brazil thrashed Bruce Banner and got beaten up by Hulk, Hulk ran from the police/army, Bruce was captured and tortured to make him angry, Hulk fought a creature which looked better than him but had the same powers. Yeah, that's all I remember from this movie. Secondly, the quality this movie offered. I really liked Edward Norton. I have no problem with his role. In fact he looked more Bruce-almighty to me than Mark Ruffalo. But the CGI ruined everything. This is the reason why the movie felt like a drag to watch. Most of the time it was just talking, talking and even more talking. The volume was also very low so I couldn't even take any interest in the talking. There was even a sex scene where Bruce starts turning into Hulk so he gives up trying. Thirdly the villain in the story was a lot more likeable than the hero, because of which I was absolutely certain in whom I should root for. And it was definitely not Hulk. The lizard dude was looking way better than Hulk. It's kinda sad that this is the only Hulk movie, but considering Hulk's enemies look better than him, there shouldn't be any more either. And lastly, the final result of this forgettable story. What did we get from this movie? It didn't progress the plot forward in any manner. It played very safe with the general superhero movie plot trend - Hero gets powers, tests them out, villain who has the same powers wants to take over the world, hero villain fight, hero wins, roll credits. It seems weird thinking this movie is a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Because this one looks absolutely nothing like the otherwise colourful, vibrant, story-rich movies. I really wish Marvel remakes this movie by editing the colour grading, CGI, sound etc. Because without that, sadly, you really HAVE to watch this movie if you want to see the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",15-Jun-21,4,0.122,0.709,0.169,0.9809,,,,,,
Luis G,"I never took Incredible Hulk as an MCU Film. It feels like a more one standalone movie. For a 2008 film, I'm not complaining for Norton Hulk's CGI. This movie looks like that it did not take time for smart writing, and the fight with Abomination was just bland. The one scene, out of the entire movie, that surprises is RDJ's Tony Stark in the post-credits. Good movie, overall.",14-Jun-21,4,0.034,0.779,0.186,0.8588,,,,,,

Jerry S,"The Incredible Hulk was pretty cool. I like Edward Norton as Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but he doesn't have that like ability as Ruffalo's. For me the best part of this movie is the action. The action scenes are brutal and fun. However even though they are fun the weakest part of the film was mostly everything else. I honestly just thought the rest of the movie was boring. I don't know I just thought it could've used a lot more fun stuff. I honestly didn't really care about the characters that much and I also just really wanted to skipped towards the action scenes. For many years people didn't know that this movie was really connected to the MCU until at Disney's Investors Day Call they announced that one of the actors Tim Roth will reprise his role as Abomination. So thanks to that news, I'm now finally going to keep an eye on this movie even more. This movie while entertaining at some parts is really lacking in others all in all it's fine. 7.8/10",30-May-21,4,0.077,0.699,0.225,0.9853,,,,,,
Andrew B,"Most would say that this and Captain Marvel are the worst MCU movies, but let's be honest. The Incredible Hulk is the worst.

Harry E,Where do I start? Edward Norton as the Hulk doesn't feel right and there aren't enough notable characters for me to want to revisit this film.

Regardless, this movie should not be forgotten about as it one of the most action packed MCU movies. The final fight scene between Abomination and Hulk had me entertained the whole time and I enjoyed every second of it. I also very much enjoy the build up of how Abomination came to be which was one of the best villain set ups yet. Edward Norton defiantly nailed it as Bruce Banner while Tim Roth was an incredible Abomination and his character arch was amazing. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the portrayal of Betty Ross and at times the movie felt slow. However, compared to the 2003 Hulk this movie knocks it out of the park and it is unfortunate that Norton couldn't keep the role as Hulk.",14-Jan-21,3,0.086,0.803,0.111,0.7557,,,,,,

As for a follow-up in the MCU, it's a little underwhelming if still passably good - at least to me. 'The Incredible Hulk' is closer to being forgettable than it is to being memorable, but that's not to say I didn't have a solid time watching. It's only really the ending that I felt dragged, yet even then it still has positive moments. I liked Edward Norton's performance for the most part, particularly early on in South America. Tim Roth is good too, though a few of his scenes irritated me slightly - perhaps more to do with how the film uses him, rather than what Roth does himself. There are a few others, but those two are the most standout. I did expect more, but there's enough there that I rate.",14-Jan-21,3,0.046,0.827,0.127,0.9244,,,,,,

Edward Norton brought the best out of the role as the troubling Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler brought a passable Betty Ross and Tim Roth brought an interesting character as Blonsky. CGI wise I very much liked the look of the hulk. The Abomination was ok and the climactic fight was epic.

Regina P,"This was the only MCU movie that I had not seen. I had to rent it from the library in order to watch it. Streaming services don't offer it outside of a 2-day rental. I wasn't really impressed with this. That is the big disadvantage in seeing this movie after seeing how far the MCU has come since then. The MCU got better and better at connecting with its audience & this film just looks lackluster compared to the later films. The action sequences were filmed in a way that made it hard to catch each movement and just uninteresting to follow, honestly. There is no origin story here; they just tell his origin through flashbacks. I hated that decision. I'm guessing they did that because the Ang Lee/ Eric Bana movie came out not long before this one. It was still a bad creative decision. I will say that the sad thing about cutting Ed Norton out of the MCU is that Liv Tyler got cut as well as a result. She fits right in with Gwyneth Paltrow, Evangeline Lilly, and Natalie Portman. That would probably be the only tragic loss with the premature ending to this story line.

Hayden L,"The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier, is somewhat the forgotten film of the MCU. Leterrier added a lot of his own directorial flare, but it couldn't overcome the cliché and misplaced feel this film has. The way the film opened up was probably the best part. They took an entire act that could've easily dragged on, and condensed it perfectly, setting up to what seems to be an intriguing story. Sadly, after the first third of the film, it started to take a downward spiral, incorporating a faster pace, and a few subplots that could've worked, but had tough transitions, and a poor execution. You can either go one of two ways to make a Hulk film. You can either make countless, high octane action scenes, with minimal character moments, or try to write good characters, and balance the action. Leterrier tried to do it the smart way, but due to it's off beat tones, slow story telling, and bland characters, this was just another flop. If you thought Iron Man 2 had a lot of production issues, The Incredible Hulk makes it seem like they only ran into speed bumps. The Incredible Hulk had a few directors disputes, then after Zak Penn wrote the script, Edward Norton scratched almost everything, rewriting the script, while all of the screenplay credit went to Penn. With the source material The Incredible Hulk has, it's tough to make a great origin story, due to a bland Bruce Banner, the not so rangey, Hulk, and a forced love interest. A few directors in the past have tried to take a crack at it, but no one was successful, so I wasn't the most optimistic coming into the film. In a weird way, it seemed like he tried to structure his story and motive around The First Avenger, having very similar sequences. Leterrier set himself up for a lot of nitpicks, not just because of some of his decisions, but all the fan service stuff he incorporated. With a talented cast in front of the camera, you'd expect at least some decent performances, but due to the on the nose writting, nobody stands out on their own. Edward Norton is one of the best talents Hollywood has today, but he simply doesn't belong in an MCU film. With such a character driven story, you need to give me more than a few unoriginal subplots and a forced love interest. Not to say I hate him in this role, because he has a few good moments, but he is just so boring with not the greatest timing or delivery; Norton didn't bring anything to his character, basically sleep walking through his performance. The scenes the Hulk is in should be the most fun, but it was just whatever. You knew there was no real risks when it comes to him, so all they did was just throw some okay at best, action scenes together, to let him smash stuff. If anyone stands out in this film, its Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, for the driest performance. She was just standing around the whole time, showing very little emotion. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, aka The Abomination, was just an old ball of clichés. Everything about his character is overcooked, falling in the same lame category as Whiplash and Ironmonger. Overall, I really try to root for this film because it's the forgotten film, and because Hulk has always been my second favorite superhero, but this just ain't it.",20-Jun-20,3,0.084,0.761,0.155,0.9961,,,,,,
Zuhayr M,"Underrated but forgettable I heard a lot of how bad this movie is and feels disjointed to the vast MCU. I agree but feel it is mostly because of Norton- Mark Ruffalo situation. When I first saw it was a good CBM, but felt very formulated 3-piece film. I am happy how they handle the origin, gamma exposure screens, quick and done cuz we have see it numerous times. Except Ross no one returns in future and I doubt many people who saw Civil war knew who he was from, let Red Hulk comeout (Hope She-hulk delivers) After many months the only scenes I vivdly remember are Hulk claps to blow away fire, even thou I am huge MCU nerd. I think the Norton-cut would have been better from film-making standpoint but idea of shared universe could have been tainted if studio interference wasn't involved.

Blake C,"Another superhero movie I watched as a kid and fell in love with, the Incredible Hulk is a forgotten MCU film. Whether that's for a good or bad thing is your opinion, but in my own, I think it's an okay film. The graphics aren't as good as I remember, and the story line is shaky at times, but the pacing is good, and it follows up the Iron Man film from 2008 pretty well. Norton's acting saves the film from falling flat, but barely a valid point, given that Mark Ruffalo is the man that God sent to play the Hulk. Upon re-watch, this movie just felt out of place. Yes, I think it was a good follow up to Iron Man, but it didn't do Iron Man 2 any favors setting it up. All-in-all, it's alright.",24-Apr-20,2.5,0.05,0.7,0.25,0.9858,,,,,,
Laurens,"I feel like the movie suffered a big blow since it releases only 2 months after Iron Man. This due to a little battle between 2 big distribution companies over who would make the best superhero movie. Iron Man is the first movie in the now big MCU and The Incredible Hulk was supposed to be part of that but ended up being a forgettable movie when people think about the MCU. I don't hate The Incredible Hulk though. The movie has something enjoyable but misses some flavor in the story in general. I think Ed Norton did a great job playing Bruce and I would have liked to see more of him down the line, but instead, he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo and I can't argue with that. Ruffalo is a great Bruce in his own right. Liv Tyler on the other hand, something feels off, and I'm not sure if it's her acting or the dialogue she is given, or perhaps a mix of the two. VFX wise it's not great but not bad either, although Iron Man did have better visuals. When it comes to music I think this movie did a good job, the theme called ""Favela Escape"" I feel captures the tense moments' Bruce is put in. If I'm not mistaken you can hear a ticking sound in the background that captures the heart rate accelerating, which is a nice touch.",22-Apr-20,2.5,0.043,0.716,0.241,0.9956,,,,,,

Yes, we get to understand that he wants to be a ""Tony Stark"", and even tries to resemble his personality, but all he manages to do is give us as viewers a lot of cringe.

Matthew D,"A fantastically exciting return to Tony Stark! Director Jon Favreau's superhero thriller Iron Man 2 (2010) is a blast to revisit. Favreau's heartfelt focus on genuine character building for Tony through his father's old tapes to his alcoholism and relationship with Pepper Potts developing. Iron Man 2 is simply a blast from the funny Stark Expo, Whiplash entering the Morocco Grand Prix with his electric whips, the Iron Man versus War Machine duel, Black Widow taking an entire hallway of men out with amazing acrobatic hand to hand combat, to the final confrontation between Iron Man and Whiplash. I even enjoy Jon Favreau's supporting character of Happy with his subtle head shakes and quick witted jokes. I am truly glad Favreau returned to direct Iron Man 2 as it is nearly as great as Iron Man with more exciting action sequences alongside deeper character decisions. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were right to entrust Iron Man to Jon Favreau. Iron Man 2 has a brilliant, hilarious, and thoughtful script from actor and writer Justin Theroux. Theroux' script gives us neat lore on Howard Stark, Tony Stark using his brilliant mind and creative science to discover a new element, and provide a frightening villain with motive and menace. Theroux clearly thought about the ramifications of Tony Stark revealing he was Iron Man at the end of the first movie, whether it's Senate hearings on oversight of Iron Man to Justin Hammer's military contracts as serious competition for Stark weapons development. I love Justin Theroux' snarky sense of humor with his clever quips and intense dialogue for Tony Stark and the villain Vanko about ethics, motives, and morality. Robert Downey Jr. is absorbing as a charming Tony Stark with his sly banter and earnest emotions. Downey Jr.'s commanding performance as Iron Man uses his skillful movements and fierce new attacks. I enjoyed the action even more upon returning to Iron Man 2. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play billionaire playboy with daddy issues Tony Stark. He feels so real and raw in his emotions with impressive nuance to his iconic narcissist. Gwyneth Paltrow is still fun as the sarcastic and concerned Pepper Potts. She's beautiful as the redhead Pepper Potts and you even feel sorry for her endless suffering under Tony Stark's erratic and eccentric wims. Her line delivery and charming personality blend well with Robert Downey Jr. as they still have romantic chemistry. Scarlett Johansson is drop dead gorgeous as Natasha Romanoff and super cool as Black Widow. She gives back all of Stark's jokes and immediately makes you love her wicked superheroine Black Widow. Johansson uses every sultry look of her eyes and twist of her body to intrigue you with her mysterious spy for S.H.I.E.L.D. I wish she got a solo Black Widow movie earlier. Don Cheadle is a major improvement as military stooge and War Machine Colonel Rhodey. Sam Rockwell is unbelievably funny as the embarrassing weapons manufacturing Justin Hammer. Mickey Rourke is legit terrifying and enthralling as Whiplash also known as Ivan Vanko. His imposing stature, gravelly voice, and dramatic gravitas add a layer of ferociousness to Vanko. He says a lot with a few of Justin Theroux' choice lines and Rourke's own acting nuances. Samuel L. Jackson establishes himself as a Nick Fury to contend with no matter if he's talking to Tony Stark or the government. Jackson has a lot of screen presence and really takes to Nick Fury naturally. Clark Gregg is quite funny as Agent Phil Coulson. John Slattery is excellent as a dismissive, sincere visionary Howard Stark. Garry Shandling is hilarious as the senator that loathes Tony Stark. Paul Bettany still sounds delightful as Tony's helpful robot butler J.A.R.V.I.S. Leslie Bibb and Kate Mara have pretty cameos for a quick laugh. Adam Goldstein cameos as DJ AM. Stan Lee plays Larry King for a cute cameo. Olivia Munn even cameos as a reporter. Editors Richard Pearson and Dan Lebental balance the strikingly smooth and fast action sequences in between the quieter dramatic scenes. Iron Man 2 has a very fast pace and stylish cuts that hit hard. Iron Man 2 barely feels 124 minutes. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique creates incredible shots with impressive wide shots during the race track encounter and close-ups during Howard Stark's presentation. I love the look of Iron Man 2 as Libatique focuses on Black Widow's every movement during her fights to all of Robert Downey Jr.'s intricate subtle acting with his face and eyes. Costume designer Mary Zophres crafts slick suits for Tony Stark and grisly outfits for Whiplash. Her tight, black dresses for Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson are unreal. Production designer J. Michael Riva's sets for Stark's home and the Stark Expo are really neat. Lauri Gaffin's set decoration is very sleek and minimalist for the lavish locales. Visual effects artists Susan Pickett, Janek Sirrs, Marc Chu, Wayne Billheimer, Ben Snow, Ged Wright, and John Walker look outstanding for Mickey Rourke's pulsating whips to Iron Man's portable transforming suit. I love the lasers here too. Sound designer Christopher Boyes provides these humongous noises for Whiplash's whip crashes and Iron Man's arc blasters. Composer John Debney writes an enthralling and mesmerizing score. I love Iron Man 2's soundtrack with AC/DC, The Clash, 2Pac, and Queen leading the fray. In all, Iron Man 2 is just as entertaining and heartfelt as Favreau's first Iron Man film.",24-Jan-22,2.5,0.078,0.725,0.196,0.999,,,,,,

However, after watching it again I came to realize how wrong I've been all this time, and now I consider it one of the most underrated Marvel Studios movies ever. I mean, an Elon Musk cameo, a scene where Tony Stark drives at the Monaco Grand Prix, the introduction of Scarlett Johanson as Natasha Romanoff and Don Cheadle as War Machine to spicy up the plot of the movie, plus a soundtrack featuring multiple AC/DC songs and Should I Stay or Should I Go by The Clash, there is nothing to dislike about that!

The points of Hammer Industries could be removed and there would be no loss to the film, and the ending falls flat for what the rest of the film is setting up.

It also introduces a lot of characters and ideals that would follow suit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe going forward.

Aidan I,Iron man 2 is the sequel to the hit film of 2008 Iron man. Right off the Bat the first iron man is a well written really fun action movie. This is sometinmes a well written movie with pretty solid acting throughout. However due to a sometimes bland story and plot points I just was not interested in I saw this movie start to drag at times. Also the villain was ok nothing special. This is still a well acted movie and it’s worth a watch it’s jus another stagnant entry into the superhero genre Grade C+,16-Sep-21,4,0.095,0.728,0.178,0.7768,,,,,,

Nathan D,"The movie is too crowded, and that is the main problem. The script is poorly written and creates an unfocused, messy film. The ""government vs. Tony Stark"" plot is intriguing and was a sophisticated plot point to explore in the first act. However, it loses itself in the 3rd act when none of it gets mentioned again. The villain of the movie is also terrible. Ivan Vanko does absolutely nothing in this film. His motives are unclear for the first hour of the movie, and there is hardly any explanation for anything he does. Justin Hammer, who also fits the villain trope, is also poorly written. A video of him almost killing someone leaks, and everyone still loves him at the end of the movie? It's just terrible writing. Trusting Justin Theroux with a story like this still makes no sense today. Theroux butchered so many characters making them feel unlikeable. For example, Tony is literally in a relationship with Pepper, but he shows interest in Natasha and other females. Yes, Tony is one to be the flirty type, but character growth is essential. No character grows in the film making for a pointless story. The only good part of the script would be the Howard Stark plot point. It brought a lot of heart to the movie and made the film watchable. Other than the script issues, everything else in the film was mediocre. The cinematography did not feel as visually stunning as the first installment. There were only a few shots that looked appealing. The production and set design also felt weak. Most of the movie takes place either in an office building or Stark's house. That does tie back into the script because there was no innovation in where the characters would be. However, that does not excuse the production and set design teams as they did not elevate those locations to make it stand out. Jon Favreau does a so-so job directing Iron Man 2, and it was nowhere near as good as Iron Man. What Favreau did on Iron Man was spectacular. In this installment, everything felt generic with no real suspense or emotion. The action sequences were one of the worst parts of the film as they had no thrill or uneasiness whatsoever. Jon Favreau was able to create that sense of fear whenever danger was around Iron Man. Yet here, it is like Tony can get out of any situation without any problems. The tone Favreau created for this movie was just not at the level it should have been. The cast was the only good part of Iron Man 2. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as always and does not disappoint even with a butchered character arc. Downey knows how to play cocky so well. Gwyneth Paltrow also does a lot better in this film than in the first installment. Paltrow's performance is watchable and made me like Pepper more as a character. Don Cheadle also does a great job in the role of James Rhode. He brought a lot more emotion to Rhodes' personality, which allowed for a better connection to him. Sam Rockwell is so unlikeable in this film. That is great since his character is supposed to be unlikeable. Lastly, Mickey Rourke is a mixed bag as, with such a terrible character arc, his performance can not save it. Overall, Iron Man 2 is a deeply flawed film that can never stick the landing in almost all of the departments of the film. Justin Theroux ruined this movie with his awful writing as he handled these principal characters in such a disappointing way. Everything else is also a step-down as only the cast can start the thrusters in this version of Iron Man.

Kate B,"Other than giving a somewhat decent introduction to Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff so as to set up the Avengers films and giving Sam Jackson some funny moments as Nick Fury, Iron Man 2 is a major letdown from its predecessor and falls into the ""sequel does worse"" trap. The film loses much of the finesse that the first one had, and manages to squander Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Whiplash shouldn't have been this movie's villain; it would've been more entertaining to watch Tony spend two hours fighting the government for control over his tech, and the writers would probably still have found some way to get Natasha into the story. At least that way it would've made more sense as a sequel to Iron Man. The big actors, both new and familiar faces, do their best in their roles, and some of the fights are entertaining to watch, but all of that isn't enough to keep this sequel afloat.

Obviously I knew the next movie was, once again, an Iron Man movie. And since I really enjoyed Iron Man, I was obviously going to like this one too. But the reviews and ratings were saying this is a horrible movie. So after I gave a view myself, the first question that came to my mind was - ""So why does everyone hate it? This was awesome!"". Iron Man 2 takes places exactly from where Iron Man left off. And that's actually for the better since it doesn't have that ""while you weren't watching our hero has done all this"" BS. Many people, most specifically Justin Hammer, are questioning about Iron Man's ethics and morals, and as to how he decides whether something is right ot wrong. They are quickly squashed down over which they get deeply offended, as they deserve to be since such people only think about everything emotionally. The movie also has a cameo appearance of Elon Musk, showing the stark similarity (pun intended) between a fictional hero and a real life businessman. The movie makes us see all the things that a world famous billionaire will have to face after becoming a superhero and still trying to live the same kind of life as he did before. He goes to the F1 racecar tournament, Ivan attacks him. He tries to party, Rhode stops him. No one sees the fact that he's literally dying. The Arc Reactor that he proudly wore and basically became a symbol of Iron Man is the same thing which is slowly killing him. Being the rich, spoilt brat that he is, he chooses to mess around because he knows he will not live long, and that's why he uses the suit to have a party, or drives in an F1 race. And in spite of being in such a big mess he never lets anyone around him, including himself, be serious about what is going through him. The CGI of this movie is just as good, if not better, than the prequel. Every time I saw Iron Man and War Machine fly around and fight I always wonder how did they possibly shoot those scenes. Seeing Iron Man in the beginning of the movie jumping from the sky and landing in the expo is also very original, just like Iron Man eating a donut or partying wearing his suit. Robert Downey Jr's acting is also phenomenal. He looks like he perfectly enters the character every time he is out of his suit. One thing I often see people complain about is that this movie has too many plots and thus it is hard to keep track of. I didn't feel any such thing. There was too much going on and yet I didn't even realise that until I was told about it. That's how nicely I believe it has strung all the plot points together. Another criticism that people give to this movie is that it feels like a filler to set up future MCU movies. This is kind of contradictory to the first complaint, and also that's literally what almost all MCU movies do. Cherrypicking this one is kind of hypocritical. However, there are a couple of things I don't like about this movie. First of all the audio quality. Even at full volume most of the conversations are barely audible. I couldn't even listen to how Iron Man goes to the bathroom with the suit on. Secondly it introduced the MCU character I hate the most - Black Widow. Throughout the movie she kept doing the same thing I hate her for: She keeps doing somersaults and X-scissors and beats entire bunch of people without taking a single hit. I looked up on Wikipedia to check if plot armour is one of Black Widow's superpower, but it turns out it's not. I'm gonna be honest here. I had forgotten this movie and only remembered the good parts. So I watched Cinemasins to write this review. And yet I can't be convinced that this is a bad movie. Look, I'm a simple man. I see Iron Man, I get excited. There's no loophole in this.",12-May-21,4,0.133,0.77,0.097,-0.9854,,,,,,
Jerry S,"Iron Man 2 was passable. This film was fun in a lot of ways, and this film was eh in a lot of ways. The eh moments were with the villains. Whiplash and Justin Hammer. I feel like Whiplash was much more interesting than Hammer and I really do feel like he should've been the main villain and Hammer. Now to be fair, there are some senes with Hammer that are pretty fun, but the most of the time he can get annoying. And I would've preferred the time to go to Whiplash. However, the one thing that I really like about this film are the heroes. Once the heroes are on screen that's where the movie picks up. That is where it starts to feel like I'm having a good time. The hero's Iron Man, Black Widow, War Machine, Pepper, Happy etc, they all work really well together and it does make film more enjoyable to watch. This film is a mixed bag. Mix of both good and eh. All in all it's okay. 7/10",6-May-21,4,0.066,0.691,0.243,0.9878,,,,,,

Robert Downey Jr. again delivers a great performance as Tony Stark and Don Cheadle feels like a better 'Rhodey' then Terrence Howard did in the first film.

And to be honest, it's disappointing because you have to watch this movie in order to keep up, meaning you have to watch through a mind-numbing plot, or should I say ""plots"". Get it?

Charlie A,"The second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (no I refuse to count The Incredible Hulk) definitely has its flaws, a lot of them actually. But the positive aspects of this film are able to counterbalance all of the things that should have made the whole film fall flat on his face. This continuation of our main protagonist, Tony Stark, has a lot of the elements that made the first film so great with a few new additions. I like the fast-paced and visually appealing action sequences. I like [most of] the main cast's acting, as always. I definitely prefer Don Cheadle's War Machine over Terrence Howard. And of course, you have Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson. The first time I watched this film was actually the first time I had seen these too, and even after watching it again in 2020, they still manage to blow me away. So I can't really say that I hate this film, but it does have a lot of flaws. There are a bunch of miniature subplots that are added throughout the movie, and most of them don't really help elevate the plot. Also, a lot of the humor in this film either felt ill-fitting or made me cringe. And then of course, there's Whiplash, the lead antagonist. He didn't really have a whole lot of potential, but every time I see him on screen, it's just a reminder of how poorly this character was written. Unlike the previous movie, Iron Man 2 isn't very memorable, and honestly hasn't aged well over the years. It's not a good movie, but it's a good Marvel movie. So I would recommend it if you liked the first movie. But this is one of those MCU films that you can just skip over if you really want to.",11-Nov-20,2,0.084,0.794,0.122,0.9269,,,,,,

RDJ is entertaining to watch and the only funny parts of the movie are the banter between RDJ and Don Cheadle. Mr. Hammer is supposed to be an annoying character, but the writing for him was just not good. He was not funny at all even when you know it's trying to be. For me, 80% of the jokes missed. I did find myself having fun with the action portion, as well as seeing Nick Fury and Black Widow. The villain is my biggest issue. He is so boring and his motive felt like a cheap way for Marvel to just further a plot. If you skipped this movie, you would not have even known that Tony Stark is getting killed by his reactor. Or it at least was not emphasized enough to notice it as the main issue. He resolves it within this movie. If you want to catch up in the MCU, I think you can honestly save your time and skip this movie. Sure you see Black Widow's entry in the MCU, but that itself is not very intriguing.

Kyle E,"I was interested in seeing this ever since it came out. After finally seeing it I am so glad I did. It is a visually stunning film with excellent cinematography and editing and the costumes, settings and effects look wonderful. There may be the odd longueur in the plot, with a little too much of admiring the scenery, but most of it is amusing and while not sticking true to the original source material there are a lot of nods to it. Kenneth Branagh directs superbly, the action is earth-shattering and the script is filled with witty fish-out-of-water moments. The acting is fine with Chris Hemsworth giving his all in the role, Anthony Hopkins bringing some welcome gravitas to Odin rather than hamming up, Natalie Portman more than a pretty face and Tom Hiddleston's Loki a villain worth watching for.

It shows us an immature Thor that the only thing he wanted was to be king and make his father proud, and the fact that his own father banishes him to Earth and takes him out of his ""comfort zone"", I think it is a success in the film. That he is on Earth makes it more noticeable that at that moment he is a human like any other, that yes, he has a lot of strength because he comes from another world, but in the movie they make him very much like a normal human, showing that he is no longer worthy, that he is no longer the God of Thunder, and that he has to fight to be worthy again. And that whole journey back to being worthy is very good, obviously with its ups and downs because as with everything Marvel there are things that don't make sense or aren't funny. But overall I find it an entertaining movie.",27-Jan-22,5,0.058,0.743,0.199,0.978,,,,,,
Random A,"Marvel Studios' Thor follows the titular character as he evolves from an arrogant, brash and impetuous boy to a compassionate man who uses his powers to help others rather than to seek out violence, which is a rich character arc throughout the movie and was very refreshing to witness. The first act of the movie was actually quite decent for me as it explored Asgard and had rich world-building and I was very impressed with the CGI. However, after Thor gets banished to Earth, the film starts to decrease in quality as the tone becomes more comedic and the storyline started to slow down for me. I was very bored with Jane Foster and I didn't feel like she had any chemistry with Thor at all, and Kat Dennings' character was especially annoying and made bad jokes which were silly and I did not laugh, or even smile at any one of them. The final third act was bland and boring, and Loki was a very bland villain in this movie, even though he received a lot of character development, which is a sign of bad execution of a character. Other than Loki, the Frost Giants had no personality whatsoever and were only a plot device for this movie. There were some emotional character moments in this film, like when Thor fails to wield his hammer. The score for this movie is rich and memorable, and I wish Marvel had more of these types of scores rather than the generic modern Hans Zimmer-like music that is throwaway and forgettable. Overall, this film has a rich character arc but was not well executed and is only average for me.",24-Jan-22,3.5,0.095,0.819,0.085,-0.4464,,,,,,

Jonathan K,"Usually I dislike when a movie is overly straightforward in its design, but Thor actually uses this to its advantage: It tells a worn, timeless story of the strong-but-arrogant hero learning to control his impulses and think about others first. This is bolstered by the fact that it's a well-written and well-acted form of this tale, and takes the shape of a surprisingly engaging Summer Blockbuster. And wow, what a Blockbuster it is! Artistically the movie is not only well done but incredibly unique, and some of the effects within Asgard are especially wonderful to look at, even to this day (ESPECIALLY the glowing bridge that looks like various colors of light blasting through a wall of glass made up of glued-together shards). It also features intense but well-staged Action Sequences, enough twists and turns to the story to keep it moving, and a genuinely entertaining sense of humor during the middle chunk, between the Shakespearian Bravado of the first Act and the Epic Greek Tragedy Final Act, and this really gives the movie a full spectrum of emotions. It's brilliantly Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the single most famous (and effective) Shakespearian Director, and the movie itself, underneath his Direction, has more than enough (but not too-much) going on.

He's not entirely bad, and even his worst qualities are very human: the ego, the jealousy.

Cailan D,"Thor has lots of visual appeal, nice performances from the cast as a whole, and entertaining action sequences which should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. Tom Hiddleston does a great job with Loki and gives us a convincing villain with a solid emotional backstory, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye cameo is welcome in the film, and it's both cool and intimidating to hear Anthony Hopkins growl as Odin. The movie takes Thor on a nice character arc which Hemsworth supplements well with his take on the character, and sets Thor up for future installments. However, the fault of this movie for me is the timeline. It takes place over only a few days, and its slightly unbelievable that Thor changes that much during that short span of time. Normally growth and personality changes take months and sometimes even years to occur, and yet Thor is able to that in just a few days. This movie would've felt more realistic if it had a time jump of a few months following Thor's banishment to Earth to truly give the character time to have an arc.

Puroo R,"I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies after the release of Infinity War, so that I could catch up before Endgame. This is the reason why I have a good hunch of which movies were very memorable and which ones were easily forgettable. This one here, however, comes under the same category as I'd put Guardians of the Galaxy under: It's memorable and forgettable at the same time. The only thing I remember from this movie is how awesome Loki was and Stan Lee's cameo appearance, but other than that, well, let's just say it all jumped over my head. It's quite surprising to see how Thor has changed so much since the time we first saw him. Since I am writing this review 4 years after Thor: Ragnarok, I think my idea of Thor has changed a lot by now. Earlier I used to think Thor can never be an interesting character, thanks to this movie. But after seeing what Ragnarok, Infinity War and Endgame did to him, it seems the entire fault was of this movie's director. He made Thor a weird looking guy. Although there's no doubt everyone looks straightup ugly in this movie, the CGI is actually pretty good. The story is pretty much straightforward: Thor has done a battle which he ruined because of his pompousness and so he has been banished on earth. His hammer has been put at some construction yard or something, and he's no longer worthy enough to lift it. It seems a lot like a copy of the first Assassin's Creed game, since there also Altaïr was the one whose post was stripped and he was sent back to the beginner's ranks. Meanwhile Loki found out he belonged to the enemy demon race and Odin had adopted him after killing his father. Loki teams up with those demons to attack Asgard. The CGI, I'd admit, is pretty good. Every time I see the Asgard road I always feel like driving a sports car on it. Humans were really boring. All they did was talking, talking and more talking. This isn't something that one'd expect from MCU, and that's pretty obvious since MCU wasn't even decided until this point. But still there should have been a good tone. The twist in the end where Loki decided to save Odin and kill the monster after the monster mentioned Loki helped him was pretty good. I had always wanted a villain to do this: Don't leave yourself vulnerable after being exposed; try to defend yourself and show that the person is lying. And after Loki lost the battle, he pretended to commit suicide in order to show that he only wanted what he believed was justice. Thor may have been a very forgettable movie, but I do remember it wasn't worth watching the second time. This movie made me fear that MCU could be boring in the future. It also ruined Thor's entire expectations for me. Throughout the movie I was only hoping it would end. The only reason I've given it a good rating is because of Loki, the CGI, and the way they were able to show Asgard's culture. Good movie, but a one time watch.",9-Jun-21,4.5,0.153,0.706,0.141,-0.917,,,,,,

Harry E,"After the last 2 Marvel Movies not being the greatest success, there was a lot riding on Thor and it Didn't really fulfill it. Thor and Loki both feel like whiny children and if that on purpose that's even worse. Anthony Hopkins delivers well as Odin and the Warriors 3 and Sif don't feel like unnecessary side characters. A lot of the scenes on earth are amusing and Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson added one of the first senses of interconnectivity in the saga. Natalie Portman wasn't the greatest and the relationship between her character and Thor felt weird. I like both Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard but yet again the final fight scene was underwhelming. I didn't feel any sadness when Loki died, when Thor nearly died or when Thor was cast out nearly chuckling at some points.

Lasse L,The first of the fantastic MCU films and it mostly holds up in terms of CGI.

Ben N,"Thor has failed at being a Superhero movie. The level set by Iron man and Dark Knight is high, but not even as high as a 'normal' drama or adventure movie. You don't have to adhere to realism in a Superhero movie, but you do need (like and Sci-fi) to set limits and respect them. You also need a real plot with characters that you care about. The characters in Thor, good guys and bad guys alike, are so thin and bland that there is no reason to become compelled by the weak plot. The fish out of water angle is not effective, the Frost Giants and Loki both have no plan, and in the end, who cares that a metal giant is blowing up gas stations in a remote New Mexico village - but apparently never hurting this God/Superhero/whatever he is or his friends. The movie never explains Asgard or Thor, where they fit into... anything and how that relates to Earth.

I don't mind them, I just think it's interesting. Thor has a character arc that is executed well.

The first act in this movie is solid, with fighting the frost giants, the backstory of taking the throne from Odin when either Thor or Loki is ready. It's when Thor goes to Earth is when the movie suffers. The human characters like Natalie Portman are not engaging. They are more annoying than anything. Some funny scenes with Thor acting crazy by Earth's standards like the hospital scene. Another weak point is the dialogue. Pretty generic especially with the characters on Earth. It upsets me that Natalie Portman is Thor's love interest. However, this movie has one of the best villains in Marvel to this day being Loki. Extremely believable character and his motive makes sense, on top of Tom Hiddleston being phenomenal. It's a fun enough movie for a watch. Don't expect to be blown away.

Asgard's set pieces were grand and felt real. Thor getting unworthy and going to earth for a fish-out-of-water story is a great storyline. I really felt bad at the middle when Thor couldn't pick up the hammer. Looking back Tom Hiddleston as Loki is phenomenal. His acting of slowly working, in the back, for jealousy and planning to trap Thor to get unworthy is so great. The Shakespearian elements were great but it cuts short for Earth's story, which is also great but both mashed together didn't feel so right. Execution could have been bettet This movie gives Thor a great character arc for worthyness but for me it felt cliche as we all knew it was ganna happen and Thor going up to the steel guy to protect his friends felt underwhelming for some reasons. The final battle of Thor and Loki was good at first watch but Loki sacrificing just for future tricks didn't work after multiple viewings. Some of the earth's character were annoying. I did like slowly building Shield in the background. The movie does a great job to set up Loki for future but inturn decrease this movies worth.",21-Jun-20,3,0.09,0.693,0.217,0.9932,,,,,,
Hayden L,"Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, had some cool ideas coming into the film, but due to a weak back story, and poor execution of the characters and script, this film ended up being decently boring compared to some of the other films we've seen in phase one. Branagh brought his Shakespearian style to Thor, that worked for better and for worse. He utilized a few decent sweeping scenery shots, but the over abundance of dutch angles, really threw me off. Just like most of the other phase one films, Thor had some production issues, hiring, firing, and rehiring castings, while swapping through directors like it was going out of style. After all the smoke was cleared, they casted great talent, and a good director. Thor had a good amount of potential to be at least decent, but it simply felt like another set up film. With such a poor fish out of water story, the expositions were left underdeveloped and dry, while the tones are completely uneven. The first half hour is pretty good, seeming to be setting up for something interesting, but come the rest of the eighty minutes, it dragged at such a slow pace, relying on the characters to drive the film, and that just didn't work in this application. From a stand-alone film prospective, Thor probably has the most talented cast, selected by Sarah Finn and Randi Hiller; all the team needed to do was make a good script, to compliment the characters, and they couldn't do it. Most of these characters are pretty disposable, lacking charm, wit, humor, and overall likability. Chris Hemsworth seems like he was made for this role. At first, he was denied the role of Thor, but he tried out again, and solidified his casting. Hemsworth does bring a lot of charm and good comedic timing to the character, but he can overcook it at times, making Thor a little more over the top than usual. With such a powerful hero, it's hard to make a solo film for him because he is just so strong, that the risks just won't be there, and that's the risk Kenneth Branagh wanted to take, and it didn't quite pay off. Branagh tried to give him a character arch, but it was just so cliché, setting up for a predictable third act. Natalie Portman is such a talented actress, but she is one of the worst love intrests of the MCU, solely because the relationship with Thor is so laughably forced and underdeveloped. Her character is just so boring, I couldn't invest myself into her. Tom Hiddleston puts on the best performance of the film, as Loki, having a good motive, and great emotional connection with Thor. He sold all of his emotions seamlessly, making everything he did and say, feel genuine. I was honestly pretty excited to hear that Anthony Hopkins was going to be in this film, not just as a side character, but as Odin! Other than him trying his best, with great delivery, he basically just hung around the whole time, while Thor and Loki got all the best lines. The action really wasn't all that present, nor memorable at that. The only halfway decent action sequence there was, was the first battle; other than that, the action was just ehh, being a massive downfall considering the power of Thor. The film has a pretty weird production scale. Asgard was ginormous, with all these vibrant colors that pop all over the screen, but when it came to when they were on earth, the small town looked way too much like a movie set, being so dull and boring. Overall, it's like salt in an open wound to say that I didn't really like this movie. It had it's moments here and there, but there was nothing that stood out to make this film stand out on it's own, and hold it's value.",19-Jun-20,3,0.075,0.697,0.228,0.9992,,,,,,

Tom Hiddleston is an amazing Loki, Chris Hemsworth is a good Thor and Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is well presented. Asgard is well shown and the film has wonderful visual effects but, despite all this, the film has other problems such as the poor characterization of Laufey (Colm Feore), Thor calling Odin (Anthony Hopkins) a fool and Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) exaggerated protagonism.

Yes, I think so. It is a very well made and efficiently directed film, with wonderful costumes, effects and settings and the cinematography and editing also impress. The music is rousing, and I just love Star Spangled Man, one of Alan Menken's best songs in my opinion. The script is witty and smart. Cheesy also? Perhaps but in an endearing sort of way. The story has a strong start, but loses its way to sluggish pacing and clichés in the final act. The characters are clichéd too in a sense but like the actors are engaging. Chris Evans is perfect in the title role, and he is joined by sassy Hayley Atwell and a wonderfully gruff Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving wasn't quite there for me, he is a great actor and he is charismatic and menacing, but his accent is inconsistent and the character could have been delved into more.

Joaquin V,"Inspiring heroism, patriotism, and perseverance. Director Joe Johnston's superhero war thriller Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is a heartfelt introduction to Marvel and America's signature superhero as he answers his calling with bravery. Johnston uses everything he learned from directing The Rocketeer and October Sky to recreate wartime America with class and style. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to get a real classic American director to direct our introduction to Captain America. His earnest feeling scenes are so emotionally driven that I really loved revisiting Captain America: The First Avenger. It remains one of Marvel's greatest films alongside Jon Favreau's Iron Man, Kenneth Branagh's Thor, or Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. Courage is a virtue Steve Rogers has in spades. I love that writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely focus on the compassion and courage that is necessary for Captain America. He has to be a patriot who fights Nazis and their ideology of hatred. I love the warm humor, deep characterization, staunch morals, and intriguing lore of Captain America. It's fun to watch a superhero in World War II fighting Red Skull's insane Nazi troops in Hydra. All the intimate dialogue feels more genuine and thoughtful than many of Marvel's following movies. Captain America really does have heart. Chris Evans fantastic casting as Captain America. He is a walking symbol for America's values now. He's charming, kind, brave, smart, strong, and cool as the man Steve Rogers and the superhero Captain America. Hayley Atwell is breathtaking as Agent Peggy Carter with a sweet and touching romance drama with Chris Evans. They really have cute romantic chemistry. Atwell is really cool as Agent Carter with her pistol and machine gun firing besides her stern commands and real gravitas in her scenes. You truly want these two war heroes to end up together. Hugo Weaving is amazing as the fearsome Nazi commander Johann Schmidt and Hydra leader Red Skull. He's actually scary as Red Skull with his imposing German accent and ruthless nature. Red Skull looks intimidating with outstanding make-up from Carmel Jackson, Lisa Westcott, Denise Kum, Maralyn Sherman, Anita Brabec, Mark English, Jacqueline Bhavnani, Sarah Grispo, Carolyn Cousins, Julie Dartnell, Rebecca Cole, Kathryn Fa, Liz Michie, Karen Cohen, Julie Kendrick, Paul Boyce, Helen Barrett, Lois McIntosh, Jenny Hammond, Brian Waltsak, Cathy Burczak, and Louise Luxton. Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious with every line as the jaded Colonel Chester Phillips. Sebastian Stan is fun and steadfast as Captain America's sidekick Bucky Barnes. Dominic Cooper is an entertaining and convincing young Howard Stark. Toby Jones's evil German Dr. Arnim Zola is funny and intriguing with his new technology. Stanley Tucci is very sincere as hopeful Dr. Abraham Ersskine in his scenes with Chris Evans. He gives Captain America his abilities and strength, but he gives Steve Rogers a real ethos. Samuel L. Jackson has a neat cameo as Nick Fury. Natalie Dormer is gorgeous and flirty in her early career cameo as Private Lorraine. Stane Lee and Jenna Coleman's cameos are nice too. Editors Robert Dalva and Jeffrey Ford keep things moving quickly for a fast paced 124 minutes that lets each scene breathe with sincerity and heart. Cinematographer Shelly Johnson's shots are wonderful for all the wide shot action and close-up conversations. Each scene lets this stellar cast act out their emotional dialogue to the fullest extent without too many cuts or quips. Rick Heinrichs's production design recreates WWII era America beautifully. The sets help you believe that you're seeing an older time. Set decorators John Bush, Mike Stassi, Patricia Klawonn, Jean Harter, and Randy Severino stuff the scenes full of period accurate props and furniture for an antique look that feels warm like Joe Johnston's other classics. The CGI backdrops hold up with effective lighting and use of space. Composer Alan Silvestri's score harkens back to fun show tunes for Captain America's theme song and inspiring melodies for his patriotic songs. I really love what Silvestri composed for Captain America as he fits Joe Johnston's serious tone and warm atmosphere. Costume designers Reese Spensley, Anna B. Sheppard, and Ken Crouch gave Agent Carter a slick uniform like the other soldiers, but it's Captain America's last outfit that looks the coolest and most detailed without looking ridiculous. In short, Captain America holds fast to strong values and good friendship. Chris Evans just is Captain America now and his on screen relationship with Hayley Atwell's Agent Carter is a high point for Marvel's emotional moments.",26-Jan-22,3.5,0.043,0.746,0.211,0.9991,,,,,,

Nick S,"Swish! Clunk! You got knocked out by a flying star-spangled red, white, and blue shield reminiscent of a frisbee. It's WW1; the world is on the brink of chaos as a Nazi sub-organization hydra plans to rule via a galactic material named the tesseract. With an army led by Hugo weavings (red skull), he seeks to hone the foreign substance by creating unlimited power and all-powerful weaponry. The world needs a signal of hope, a hero. Chris Evans plays this signal, the MCU's first avenger (captain America) with mastery. As the story transpires, Captain America (Steve Rodgers) discovers purpose, bravery, and romance as he proudly accepts the role he was so unexpectedly given but so rightfully deserved.

Bradley W,"Captain America the First Avenger is a fun film to watch, but there is still a looming feeling of pointlessness behind it. The film seems to rush through some plot points as if knowing that it has to introduce Steve Rogers, give him the serum, introduce the tesseract, and then freeze Steve so he can wake up in modern day New York City for The Avengers movie. The times watching the Howling Commandos, Steve, and the rest of the characters interact are some of the most fun, and its sad to know we won't see them again in the future. There are a lot of fun scenes throughout the film, and some scenes that could be cut or trimmed down. The second viewing of this movie I definetly appreciated it a lot more than the first time I watched it, and it makes me want to see more from the side characters featured in it. If doing an overall rewatch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe this is one that can probably be skipped, but I do suggest checking it out for a good sci-fi action world war II comic book movie.",16-Dec-21,5,0.067,0.819,0.114,0.8381,,,,,,

Esta película me encanta porque se siente la entrega que todo el equipo tuvo en esta película, y se nota en cuanto transcurre la misma.

Nathan D,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a decent film. It isn't a terrible film, but I don't think it is a great film. A lot of that has to do with the writing which I think is a bit rough. The story is good and the basic plot is good enough to support a movie. However, I think screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely try a little too hard to make the story feel much grander than it should be. There are a lot of scenes where I was sitting there wondering why they added certain lines in. Some scenes felt dragged on with useless information that didn't feel necessary to the overall plot. Information that was needed to have the story flow right felt rushed and sometimes poorly written. The writing also makes the pacing of the movie feel very wonky. The first 45 minutes of the movie really take a long time and nothing major happens besides Steve's transformation. Once things start ramping up, it doesn't quite visually look good. A lot of the action sequences in the film are poorly coordinated with stunt coordinator Steve Dent making all the action movements feel so corny and bland. I guess that could play into the 1940s aspect of the film, but it still didn't look all that convincing when watching the film. The editing in this film was also very poorly done. A lot of the cuts made were very harsh and didn't exactly look or flow right. This hurt the action sequences a lot as there were random cuts to characters making different movements than the clip before making the sequences look even more sloppy. Plus, the VFX looked a bit off in some parts of the film. The pre-serum Steve looked wonky at times and didn't feel real. The cast does a great job in this film with a lot of great performances. Chris Evans does a good job giving that American charm while having that tough guy/kind-hearted type of personality. I do wish that he would have played with his voice a bit when he was pre-serum Steve just because it was a little awkward to hear this deep voice coming out of such a scrawny guy. Hugo Weaving also does a good job as Weaving was very good at playing a villain. I would have loved to have seen more of him in this movie. Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan really know how to make their characters stand out in the film with a lot of fun lines that were delivered very nicely. Tommy Lee Jones was the only actor I didn't care for in this film as I thought his performance was very muted and monotone. Jones's line delivery was off at points and he doesn't exactly create any exciting moments in the film. However, other members of the supporting cast like Dominic Cooper and Stanley Tucci do a very nice job for the handful of scenes that they are in. Something I do like about this film is the costume and hairstyling. Everything really felt very clean and had outfits that fit the actors perfectly. I especially love Captain America's suit in the 2nd act. The roughness to it really adds a lot of character to it while still keeping those iconic red, white, and blue colors. The production design was also pretty stellar here as the setting really felt like 1940's New York. Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger is a solid film that just needed some more work. The post-production aspects of the film were severely flawed and the script wasn't all that great. However, wIth a strong cast, great costuming, and realistic production design, the film does make for a fun watch. Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely one of the weaker origin superhero films, yet still enjoyable.

Cailan D,"The First Avenger is a nice origin story with a retro/old-fashioned vibe for Steve Rogers. The action, dialogue and story are all solid and the visuals in the film are a breath of fresh air from previous ones in the MCU. Chris Evans does a great job portraying the morally righteous yet somewhat awkward supersoldier, and the supporting cast members give solid performances as well. The movie avoids the trap of squandering some of its A-list actors, such as Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones, and sets some others on the path to the A-list, namely Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan. First Avenger does a nice job of setting up future MCU films without getting too focused on that and spends a good amount of time allowing us to get to know who Steve Rogers is. Nick Fury's cameo at the end to set up Cap's appearance in the Avengers movies is well placed and nicely begins Rogers' arc as an Avenger. My only real complaint is why Nick Fury had two cameos in this movie: one at the end and one as the mid/post-credits scene. Having him appear at the end just once is more than enough to set him up for the Avengers movies and the credits scene creates redundancy with the Avengers. Overall, while it doesn't quite hit the bar set by Iron Man, First Avenger is a solid origin story and entry in the MCU.",19-Jul-21,1.5,0.052,0.816,0.132,0.9578,,,,,,

Gonalo A,Boa maneira de começar a assistir à franquia Marvel. Gostei do cotexto da 2ª Guerra Mundial e da transformação do Steve Rogers. Foi assumindo o papel de capitão América sem nunca ser pretensioso. Existem alguns momentos do filme como algumas lutas e em que o Capitão anda aos beijos com uma secretária do exército que considero que foram desnecessárias.

Like the part we're Steve gets the serum, when he first meets Peggy Carter, when he goes off to save Bucky and the rest of the hostages, and when he goes off on his first missions in the war. And even though that the film came out in 2011 the VFX hold up really well. However the one problem that I have in this movie is that I would like to know a little bit more about Captain America. I really wanted to go into a bit deeper of who he is. We do get a good idea what his life was like through the film and in the other movies, but me personally I would like to know more.

Puroo R,"When I had begun watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I was waiting for the movie in which Captain America shows up. For some reason I really liked Captain America back then, because of how his weapon is just a shield; no sword, no bows and arrows, no hammer. It showed how he believes his arms are the equivalent of the said weapons. This logic could have made sense if he was as strong as, say, Wonder Woman (and yet she uses a sword). But he's just as strong as a strong man, and yet he has this confidence. And that's what made him special for me. I had literally no idea what I was going to expect in this movie. I watched it with a complete blank slate. I didn't even know Captain America's real name is Steven Rogers. That's how less I knew of him. I just admired him because, well, I've already said it. The setting of the movie is during the time of World War II. Steven Rogers was just a lanky man back then who was very determined and patriotic. He gets beaten up in an alley by an anti-national and saved by a military man, but even when he is getting beaten he does not give up. He is taken in the army and allowed to train like the rest for the World War. But seeing him jump on the grenade to save everyone, they realise something must be done for him. And so they give him the super soldier serum, thus making him Captain America. Earlier used as a prop to cheer the US Army during the war, Captain America is soon sent on multiple missions where he and his best friend Bucky Barnes fight the Nazis. Bucky faces a sad demise, and soon the enemy commander is revealed to be the infamous Red Skull. Captain America and Red Skull fight, Captain beats Red Skull but soon after faces a plane crash. He is revived years later before the events of The Avengers can take place. There are a lot of things I like about this movie. First of all, the idea of a superhero like Captain America. Like I mentioned earlier, I really liked the idea that the hero has no equipment other than a shield. So seeing the hero fight in close combat while all his enemies have powerful guns is very interesting. The reveal of Red Skull was also a huge moment, and so was his apparent death, which was rewarding in Avengers: Infinity War. The cinematography also looked really amazing, and the message that this movie gives is also very positive. Overall this movie is really fun and wholesome to look at. But there are a lot of things I didn't like about it as well. First of all the audio. Most of the times it was hard to hear the dialogues. The whole time the scientist guy was speaking I was like, ""What? Huh? He is a what? What are you saying about Nazis?"" Same goes for the interrogation scene of that vegetarian scientist. What was his name again? Oh wait, I remember. I COULDN'T HEAR IT! The second problem, like literally every other MCU movie, is the unbelievable action scenes. There is no way I can believe that Captain America sneaked inside one truck, beat up all the bad guys, then hit the guard with his shield while all the other guards have their backs towards him and walk out silently with his glow-in-the-dark shield and no one notices him. And the jump cuts during the action scenes, dude, it's so hard to make out what's going on because of the continuous camera angle change. The post credit scene felt like sequel baiting, and it was unnecessary since that very same scene was also shown in The Avengers. They should have kept it in either one of the two movies. But other than that I enjoyed the movie. Unlike most Marvel Cinematic Universe movies where I find the movies to be a one-time watch, I won't mind seeing this one all over again. It is really a mindless, wholesome, fun to watch family movie.",29-Apr-21,4,0.123,0.699,0.178,0.9953,,,,,,

I will say it is not my favorite MCU movie and it is also not perfection, but it is truly solid and made me question my somewhat lifelong indifference to Captain America. I don't know if it is that squeaky clean characters don't peak my interest as much but both Marvel's Captain America and DC's Superman were not my favorites. This movie made me rethink my life choices. The story is moving; Evans giving him a lot of heart and spunk and, while it is an origin story and really just a set up for future films, it really leaves you feeling satiated at the end. The look and feel from the color schematics and set choices transport you back to another time, and the gnawing need that men of that generation had to serve their country in WWII is palpable in this film; our protagonist desperate to be seen as fit for duty, shed childhood, and throw himself into manhood. In real life I like good guys, but brooding bad boy Superheroes always drew me in. This movie changed that. Ever the gentleman, when Rodgers tells Peggy he is just waiting for the right dance partner intimating she is it, though, he says it with all sincerity and you are sure there may be more than dancing in that remark. These two have a connection but also conviction to their missions, and it makes this couple even more intriguing. It is a buddy movie. It has romance. It is a hero movie with a whole lot of fantastic action sequences. This good guy film is a great watch.",23-Mar-21,5,0.056,0.766,0.178,0.9901,,,,,,

Chaine A,"Captain America (and Bucky) are simply the best of all the Avengers. They're from our ""Greatest Generation"" an era where all Americans and its allies fought TOGETHER against fascist dictators such as Hitler in WWII.. Today we fight each other because of a fascist authoritarian who was our POTUS in the past four years. We could have worked with ALL other countries to stop a virus pandemic killing millions around the globe. Thanos = SARS-CoV2 and all variants. This is the virus that causes COVID-19. Cappy is pure of heart, doing all for love of his country...and Peggy! Much better that the narcissistic Tony Stark played by an equally egotistical narcissistic damaged Robert Downey Jr. Even Chris Pratt, the clueless dumb leader of Guardians of the Galaxy, is a Trump loyalist, sycophant. Cappy played by a down to earth Chris Evans is who we need. During the pandemic lockdown, he showed himself sitting at his piano playing Chopin from memory. All the other Avenger actors basically responded with ""Wow! Is there anything that Chris can't do?! My dad was in WWII and a survivor in the Bataan Death March (Google it!) and I was in Vietnam with the 44th Medical Battalion at Khe Sanh. I spoke a lot w my dad that we cheated and murdered 2 million rice farmers in our fight against ""communism."" My father cried for our country and its lies. (Google ""Pentagon Papers."") 60 million ppl died in WWII in a fight against all fascist dictators...Hitler, Mussolini, Emperor Hirohito. Today crazy ppl think antifa is our greatest threat. These dumb lapdogs don't even understand that ""antifa"" means ""against fascism!"" We have enough narcissistic billionaires like Musk, Bezos and Zuck. We need good hearted leaders who believe in true equality for poor and middle classes. Cappy is a born leader. Ironman is a mess just looking out for himself...like ""The Former Guy"" he loves building outrageously ugly tall buildings then affixing his name in large letters! STARK=TRUMP. Cappy is just the best! Also a big shoutout to Hugo Weaving as ""Red Skull."" What a villain! As he was in The Matrix trio.",11-Mar-21,5,0.195,0.694,0.111,-0.9875,,,,,,

Seeing Tony's dad is fun, Peggy Carter is one of my favorite Marvel love interests, and the action is clean and you can see it. Seeing all this praise, you would think I would rate this higher. Well, the villain was a little too ridiculous for me, and Bucky didn't get enough screen time. You couldn't really feel his connection with Cap that well.

We sit in the wrong seat, have to re-purchase tickets, I'm complaining, the whole thing is a mess and we're just confused. Then we adapted to that model of movie-going. Now, we're just watching stuff all at home! So we're like Captain America, adjusting to modern times. This movie was better in retrospect, seemed by the numbers in 2011 but that's really just due to the seating fiasco! They really set up a ton of stuff in this movie that I 100% forgot about, and it was actually cool to re-watch it. I should prob NOT watched this trilogy in reverse order.

Logan C,"""Captain America: The First Avenger"" I wish this movie would have delivered. Based on the title, I was expecting to be more intrigued than I was. The First Avenger in the MCU should be something cool to watch. Chris Evans (Captain America) acts well in this movie along with his buddy ""Bucky"" (played by Sebastian Stan). The character did not sit well with me in this. Captain America is my favorite hero in the MCU, but this is a weak version of him compared to what we know now. I did like his whole transformation scene although the chase right after looked pretty corny and weird. The action sequences were decent as well. The best part of the movie though is the villain played by Hugo Weaving (Red Skull) Red Skull is played extremely well in this movie and is a very believable character. It's pretty campy with him basically wanting to rule the world, but to be fair, he works with the Nazis. The lines are corny, the cinematography is nothing to brag about, as well as the CGI being just OK. But knowing what is coming after this movie and what it sets up, helps me enjoy it more.

Gage W,"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",24-Feb-22,4.5,0.058,0.727,0.215,0.9985,,,,,,

Mateo L,"It is mind-blowing. If I remember correctly it's the first crossover of so many heroes, and it's really enjoyable. The characters don't need 100% development because the foundations were already laid by the individual movies of each one, and there isn't one that doesn't stand out. Seeing that clash of personalities, how they are not perfect at first and seeing how they join forces to save the world from Loki. A Loki who had already left good feelings in Thor, and especially in that post-credits scene where they show us who will be the first super villain that The Avengers will face. The only bad thing I see is that this is the last time we will see that Hulk we like so much, because from Age Of Ultron, everything goes down. I give it only 4 stars because even though it's excellent, I don't think it's at the level of its second sequel (Infinity War).",27-Jan-22,4.5,0.058,0.798,0.144,0.9334,,,,,,
Matthew D,"An entertaining spectacle of superhero team-up flick with character drama and quaint quips. Director Joss Whedon's superhero action-thriller The Avengers (2012) is sure to please all viewers seeking enthralling action, but disappoint the Marvel fans wanting stronger character arcs like the individual hero movies. I loved the thrill of watching all of Marvel's greatest superheroes team up together in one movie. The Avengers surely is a great accomplishment and a thoroughly entertaining one from Iron Man fighting Thor to Black Widow evading The Hulk. The Avengers is nearly all action among the cute character interactions. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor are all better made movies with stronger character development, stories, writing, and direction. Whedon brings Marvel's comic book superheroes to life all for a massive brawl in New York against Loki and some goofy aliens. The action sequences are exciting and well thought out with several memorable moments. I just found Whedon's overall direction messy and lacking real depth for each character. He turns each nuanced superhero from the previous films and turns them into Whedon quip quoting machines. Everything is a punchline or pop culture reference suddenly. Writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn focus too much on the comedy and action and forget to give these characters detail, motivation, and nuance. It's all about the one-liner jokes and I think that severely detracted from these otherwise interesting characters. I appreciate that producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige planned this all out to get The Avengers to assemble in a way that makes sense, but I thought Loki's alien attack narrative is really boring and just an excuse to give The Avengers a horde of faceless enemies to destroy. Robert Downey Jr. is very funny and charming as Iron Man as he gets to show off his quick thinking and scientific skills. Chris Evans remains a bastion of American patriotism and earnest heroism. Mark Ruffalo takes over for Edward Norton as the inner turmoil of rage that is Bruce Banner. His Hulk is really fearsome with cool action sequences and fun moments like Hulk punching the space whale. Chris Hemsworth's Thor loses his serious god personality and turns more into a joke spouting character, but his hammer and thunder powers are still killer. Scarlett Johansson is amazingly nuanced as Black Widow as she outwits every man she encounters and looks drop dead gorgeous as the redhead Natasha Romanoff. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is super cool and shines in The Avengers with her clever spy skills and combat prowess. She always feels genuine as Natasha Romanoff. I really do appreciate Scarlett still delivering excellence in dramatic acting as Black Widow, who may be my favorite aspect of The Avengers upon revisiting this beloved blockbuster. Jeremy Renner gets taken over as Hawkeye, so we don't really get to know him yet. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is both scary and entertaining with his hateful smirks and cruel jests. Samuel L. Jackson is actually tough and commanding as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. Cobie Smulders just appears as Agent Maria Hill, but she's fairly engaging. Clark Gregg gets quite the emotional farewell as Agent Phil Coulson. Stellan Skarsgård is wasted as Loki's science plot device. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming alongside Robert Downey Jr. I wish we got more time with her endearing Pepper Potts. Editors Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek cut neatly around the fights, but it can all get lost in how chaotic the action sequences get. Seamus McGarvey has some inspired medium and close-up shots of each hero and them fighting alongside one another, but his wide shots are often really dull to look at compared to the more intimate spaces. The CGI is fine, but has moments that look pretty ugly, especially with all the washed out colors in every scene. Composer Alan Silvestri created an instantly iconic theme song for The Avengers. I really love Soundgarden's end credits song ""Live to Rise"" also! In all, The Avengers is a very fun movie, that could have been much better honestly.",27-Jan-22,4.5,0.13,0.625,0.245,0.9987,,,,,,

This is a movie that needs to be watched, it is easily still one of my top favorite marvel movies, and it holds up to this day as a great film. While the plot itself is simple, the characters and actions scenes within this movie hold it together and make it a fun movie to watch, even with its dialogue heavy middle. This is a must watch again with Avengers Endgame coming up, as it is the first time these characters were brought together on the big screen. With its importance there, and Endgame being the final send off for Infinity Saga, I would be very surprised if this movie isn't heavily referenced at some point within the film.

Anthony K,"Where it all began, Marvel's The Avengers did what no other movie dared to do, having a large ensemble of heroes, a lovable villain and having an at the time original arc of having the team learn to work together. It's your average run of the mill blockbuster, but a hell of a one at that! Without a doubt this movie's greatest achievement is its all star cast and the chemistry they share, from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr, to the stoic and comedic Samuel L. Jackson, every cast member is perfect in their respective roles and the way they bounce off of each other is just remarkable! The VFX are also outstanding, most of them have aged rather well. This movie does have one glaring problem however, and that is the middle act. It's nowhere near as enjoyable as the other two, its incredibly slowly paced, and doesn't impact the plot is almost any way. All in All, Marvel's The Avengers is just phenomenal in every way.

Cailan D,"The Avengers is a movie that could've easily been a mess and turned out to be a masterpiece thanks to Joss Whedon. The movie nicely culminates the five ones that came before it in the MCU and gives all of the Avengers moments to shine. The action is fantastic, the visuals raise the bar for future MCU films, and the movie ends on a high and satisfying note that leaves plenty of room for future character development and storytelling. The script gives each of the Avengers moments to show us who they are and how they fit into this broader universe. Loki is a great villain for this film due to him being a familiar face and having a direct connection to one of the Avengers, and Tom Hiddleston again gives a strong performance as the character, which is all bolstered by the script giving him a few moments to shine and one-liners as well. The acting in general is good, with both new and familiar faces doing the best they can with their roles. Renner is done a bit dirty in the film, but the big battle redeems that slightly and Renner makes the best of the screen time he has. Unlike some previous MCU movies, this one has lots of rewatch value and will still be entertaining to many on multiple viewings.

Kate B,"This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. Sure, it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring. It's not just because there is a lack of action because that's not true at all. In fact within the first hour or so there are four fight/action scenes. But the way they are brought about are almost laughable. The movie gets good once the hulk transforms on the helicarrier. Scenes aren't lit very well and it almost looks like a episode of firefly. But it's not. It's a huge action blockbuster with a budget in access of 200 million dollars. You can say whatever you want about Joss Weadon. Whether you love him or hate him I just don't think he's cut out for these kinds of movies. The characters have fine chemistry but they aren't given enough time to shine either on their own or as a team. Some of the action is fine I guess but there are certain scenes where I cannot tell what's happening at all. To prove my point watch the Thor and Loki fight scene on the top of Stark Tower. Overall Avengers is painful for about an hour and then slightly bolster for the remainder of the run time. Would have to wait at least three years to watch this again.",13-May-21,4.5,0.128,0.753,0.12,-0.4722,,,,,,

Puroo R,"The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I learnt about. Everyone was going crazy. Meanwhile I, who didn't know the basics of comic book superheroes, was wondering why are Superman, Batman and Spider-Man not on the cover of this movie. Just a few years ago I watched all the movies from the franchise when Infinity War came out just to know what the fuss was all about. And now that I see it, I understand why it was such a huge deal. After the events of Thor, Loki comes on earth to steal the Tesseract from SHIELD, and he does manage to do that. Meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy. All the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies. Although what they are doing is not very interesting, it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are. And then they all come together, beat Loki and save the day. A pretty straightforward story moved by character development. There are a number of things I like about this movie. The scene where their airship's propeller stops working so Iron Man spins it so fast that it stabilises. It showed how strong and fast Iron Man is. There was also the scene where Iron Man goes through the portal and throws the missile away. It completely contradicts what Captain America considered him to be, showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie. I also like how Tony goes to have a word with Loki and tells him that the Avengers have a Hulk against his entire army. I mean I could literally go on about what a badass Iron Man was throughout the movie. Then there were Thor and Hulk. I really liked Thor ever since I first heard of him. He literally looks like a Norse god capable of highly destructive powers. Hulk, on the other hand, I didn't like him very much when I heard about him. Even in The Incredible Hulk he wasn't really entertaining. But here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of Bruce Banner. He gets angry every time someone calls him Bruce instead of Hulk, which shows how much he is struggling for his identity. Thor is just as awesome as I thought him to be. I always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape. The visual effects were done really nicely. Though the impact of their powers wasn't very hard, but it's a campy movie. What can we possibly expect? It's from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight, be it Gimli from Lord of the Rings, Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars or Hound from Transformers. But the destruction was surely visible. Most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander. That is something I really like; it's literally the reason why I like Monsterverse. It is seen especially in the scene where Hulk rides the giant snake robot. Though there are a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie. First of all, the campiness. Obviously in today's time it's quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadn't been utilised properly, but the very same year The Dark Knight Rises came and the next year Man of Steel came. Both of them had the mature touch to it. Even the MCU movies before and after this one like Thor and Captain America: The Winter Soldier looked more mature than this baby thing. The other criticism I have towards this is Black Widow and Hawkeye. I hate botht he characters, and even more I hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them. The jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying. Every fight scene, especially the ones which have Black Widow in them, have like, a dozen scene cuts just to show that Natasha did a cartwheel, got on the bad guy's shoulders and snapped his neck. The same goes for Captain America and Hawkeye also. Not even once has Hawkeye shot anything in one take. It's something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double. Obviously this doesn't look special anymore, since I watched it after Infinity War had released, so there wasn't much of a surprise other than the fact that it's a team up movie. It has a good place in my memory so I wouldn't want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation. It's good in its place, it's a product of its time. It should stay that way. It's a one time watch in case you haven't seen it.",28-Apr-21,5,0.111,0.775,0.114,-0.5294,,,,,,

Loki is a much improved character feeling more like a villain than a whiny little kid. I'm pretty sure everyone got goosebumps when watching them stand together to the amazing theme by Alan Silvestri. The near death of Tony Stark feels touching and is done well. My only real quarrel is how it leads onto Thanos too much even though Marvel had already made plans for the next Avengers film to be Ultron. This is the main reason that Avengers: Age of Ultron had such disappointing reviews.

But then this movie came out and the film industry was never the same again. It was a game changer, a milestone and arguably the most important film (not the best, just the most important) since the original Star Wars. Now everybody wants to be like Marvel.

Ben Kingsley sells that entire plot line very well. *END OF SPOILERS* Shane Black is no Jon Favreau, but I don't think he's trying to be.

Matthew D,"A delightfully funny and touching reflective piece for the third installment of Iron Man. Director Shane Black's superhero action-comedy adventure Iron Man 3 (2013) is a high buzz of deliriously funny jokes and intriguing character drama that gets to the heart of Tony Stark's heroism. The entire point is about Tony Stark facing the consequences of his actions from cruelly blowing off a scientist, sleeping and ditching a ""botanist"" lady, to just simply getting Pepper Potts a terrible Christmas present. Shane Black's direction is a blast of chaotic action sequences that are well thought out in choreography and logic with Stark beating bad guys with wit as much as Iron Man's repulsor rays. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust Shane Black with Tony Stark's complex character and wicked humor for his stellar Iron Man 3. Shane Black and Drew Pearce's writing is not only clever with their irreverent sense of humor, but also genuinely heartfelt as you see that indeed Iron Man's heroism comes from Tony Stark's bravery and perseverance. Stark grows as a man and learns new and innovative ways to be heroic. His genius intellect must be used to save lives and be kinder than he used to be during his days as a sleazy billionaire playboy. I found Black and Pearce's writing exceptionally profound as Tony Stark must solve his problems without the effortless use of his Iron Man suit as the real hero is the man himself. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious again as Tony Stark as he feels cool and in control no matter how dire things get. Robert Downey Jr. plays up Stark's trauma and anxiety over nearly dying to aliens and a nuclear bomb in New York back in The Avengers. It feels thoughtful and funny as those scenes are due to Robert Downey Jr.'s insane charisma and natural hilarity. Robert Downey Jr. shows Tony Stark's failings and mistakes as well as his willingness to fix problems and deep character flaws at Stark's convenience of course. He just is Tony Stark really. Robert Downey Jr. gets the sincere, cute, and sarcastic romance drama exactly right alongside the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow as the fierce and caring Pepper Potts. All of Gwyneth Paltrow's expensive pantsuits and cute dresses look fabulous on her too from fashionable costume designer Louise Frogley. She's particularly breathtaking in Iron Man 3. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts will always have my favorite romance story of all the MCU movies. Gwyneth Paltrow is so playful in a snarky way, while also feeling distinctly mature for Marvel's movies. She handles Robert Downey Jr.'s ridiculous attitude and flippant remarks with a cool ease and deft grace. Gwyneth Paltrow makes Pepper Potts as endearing as Tony Stark honestly and even gets a killer finale sequence in Iron Man 3. Don Cheadle is quite funny and steadfast as Iron Man's sidekick Rhodey. He went from fun and reliable as War Machine to a true blue government stooge as Iron Patriot, even though I like the name. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a fantastic villain with understandable motivation. His fearsome fire breathing and red hot melting point powers are wild to behold. Rebecca Hall is so interesting and serious as Maya Hansen. She's a brilliant foil for Tony Stark and has a sweet scene with Pepper Potts too. Jon Favreau's Happy has never been funnier or more ridiculous with his pompous attitude as Head of Stark Security. Sir Ben Kingsley is phenomenal as The Mandarin because he is genuinely frightening with his deep voice and harsh lessons for America, while getting seriously hilarious scenes in the last act. Stephanie Szostak is gorgeous as Brandt and really intimidating with her firebrand ferocity. James Badge Dale is cool with his calm presence as the fiery villain Coldblood. William Sadler has a fun cameo as The President of The United States of America. Dale Dickey is touching in her mournful cameo. Ty Simpkins is cute as the eager engineer boy Harley, who helps Tony Stark in his hour of need. Paul Bettany's voice is excellently sarcastic as J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man 3. Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, George Kotsiopoulos, and Stan Lee of course all have quick funny cameos. You can see a young child actress Jenna Ortega as the Vice President's daughter. Corey Hawkins even has an early career cameo as a radar monitor before Straight Outta Compton. Mark Ruffalo's cameo startled me with laughter. Apparently, Fan Bingbing has a fast cameo in Iron Man 3 somewhere. Editors Jeffrey Ford and Peter S. Elliot cut so quickly during the exciting action, while allowing the drama scenes to gently garner emotions. Iron Man 3 does not even feel half its 130 minute length. Cinematographer John Toll captures magnificent wide shots of Tony Stark's mansion falling into the sea to intimate close-ups of Robert Downey Jr. mourning Pepper Potts or contemplating his regrets and anxieties. Iron Man 3 looks excellently shot just like Jon Favreau's Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Production designer Bill Brzeski keeps Stark's seaside manor looking like a cool set with neat small town sets that look believable. Danielle Berman's set decorations add all sorts of technological props to Tony's labs. Art directors Alan Hook, Jason Bistarkey, Brian Stultz, Desma Murphy, and Jay Pelissier lean into terrorist imagery and fearmongering with crazy dark footage for Marvel alongside Stark's hopeful Iron Man suits getting rebuilt. The CGI feels advanced far beyond even The Avengers or early Marvel movies. Composer Brian Tyler opts for a darker and moodier score than the first two Iron Man films. His music effectively takes you into Tony Stark's mindset and conflicted feelings the entire movie. Sound designer Mark P. Stoeckinger adds these burning flame sounds and massive explosions alongside cool pulse noises for Iron Man's repulsor rays. In conclusion, Iron Man 3 is a real blessing from Shane Black as his movie alongside John Favreau's Iron Man and Iron Man 2 are all fantastically endearing and entertaining movies.",28-Jan-22,3.5,0.112,0.645,0.243,0.9995,,,,,,

The movie could be improved with just a couple more months of editing and the removal of some elements that slow the pace of the movie down such as the kid, and some reworking of the Mandarin villain would have been nice. If doing an Avengers rewatch of the past Marvel Cinematic Universe movies this is an easy one to skip, but not a bad one to check out again if deciding to watch the Iron Man trilogy.",16-Dec-21,1.5,0.062,0.841,0.097,0.6899,,,,,,

Some people complain Tony is not in a suit enough and sure, but isn't that kind of the point? It's forcing him to be a hero without being able to always depend on his tech, and there are still more suits in this movie than the others.

Nathan D,"Iron Man 3 was such a joy to watch as there were so many great moments throughout the film. The script is solid and doesn't shy away from any aspects, which leads to a great viewing experience. The main villain of the movie is rooted, and his motives are clear. Is he the best villain? No, but he gets the job done. The character arcs in this film are so much better here than in the second installment. Tony grew as a person and was able to become a better person overall. If I had to nitpick the script, I think I would have toned down the political tones a bit. It began to be a lot at times which I think was unnecessary. Another thing was that it felt a bit predictable at times. Using the shady businessman for the third time in a row does get a bit repetitive. Shane Black does a stellar job directing this installment and is on par with Favreau's work on the first film. There were plenty of scenes that felt inventive and unique, making the film have very few dull moments. Even with the more serious scenes, it still had the emotion it needed to be entertaining. To accompany Black's directing is some solid cinematography from John Toll. There are a lot of shots that look very nice and have some significant elements to them. Sadly, those two aspects get brought down by the harsh editing in the film. The action sequences have too many cuts leaving the scenes to feel rushed and messy. There are even a few scenes where some cuts don't match up with the shot before. The score does make up for this as it keeps the energy up in some of the scenes. Composer Brian Tyler created this bombastic score that impacted the film profoundly. The production and set design are also very attractively done. Many visually appealing locations complimented Shane Black's vision quite nicely. The cast also does a fabulous job here with stand-outs all around. Like always, Robert Downey Jr. shines on screen. This performance is the most human he has felt in any of the three Iron Man movies as he and Black translated what was on the script to the screen very nicely. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to do great in the role of Pepper Potts. Although, her performance in Iron Man 2 is still the best out of the three movies. Ben Kingsley is outstanding here and created a lot of entertaining moments in the film. I can see why some people do not like his performance, but I thought he was a lot of fun. Guy Pearce is also a solid addition to the cast. His acting seems bland at times, and it does not help that his character is somewhat the same as the other two films in the franchise. Supporting cast members like Ty Simpkins, Rebecca Hall, and Don Cheadle are fantastic in the movie. Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed blockbuster that is so enjoyable to watch. The film does have a few blemishes in the script and editing department. Yet, the entertainment factor helps hide it at times. An exceptional cast, an outstanding score, and marvelous directing make Iron Man 3 a stand-out film in Marvel's cinema catalog.

Dan C,"I go to see a super hero movie to see a hero being super, not spending virtually the entire film dealing with PTSD. The villain is generic and forgettable, and the twist is rather insulting, especially to hardcore fans. The suit that makes Iron Man who he is comes off nigh-indestructible in every other Marvel film, now the thing just flies to pieces if he gets hit just a little too hard? And he spends less than a quarter of the movie in it. Wow, how inspiring. I get that they were trying to go for 'Iron Man is the MAN, not the armour', but it just falls apart.

Ethan T,"Iron Man 3 is an average popcorn superhero film saved by Downey Jr. in the lead role. His smarmy yet lovable Iron Man is always a sight to behold. The action alternates between a decent showcase of big-budget CGI and illogical messiness. Paltrow and Downey work well together and Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany (voice) seem to have fun. Simpkins is a rare likable child star, but the positives end there for the supporting cast. Guy Pearce brings all of the campiness and not much else for a villain. Ben Kingsley is very welcome in another villainous role but does little to justify his inclusion apart from a bit of hit and miss comic relief. The comic relief in general does not completely miss, but could be stronger and telegraphs much of its humour in advance. Rebecca Hall did alright, though it's another case of her not quite bedding into admittedly daft proceedings as with Transcendence. Iron Man 3 is above all light-hearted fun, and this covers its faults without coming close to setting the world alight.",25-Aug-21,4.5,0.079,0.715,0.206,0.9797,,,,,,

Tyler S,"Imagine not liking this version of the Mandarine. I love Trevor, and he might be one of the best Marvel characters. But, someone did make a good point about Marvel making all of the villains in witty comedy pieces. It happened with Loki in ""Loki"" and ""Thor Ragnarok"", Zemo in ""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" and The Mandarine in ""Iron Man 3"". It isn't really the best ideas to make people who tried to kill everyone on the Earth best friends with the main characters. Robert Downey Jr. always puts out his best as Tony Stark. The Ironman franchise is one of my favorite trilogies in cinema history. I'm sad his story is over, but I am so happy about his character arc throughout the MCU.

Brian H,A hilariously underrated marvel movie. This film has some of the best marvel action scenes and the best part is that they all serve the story. Say what you want about the Mandarin twist but the fact that they are clearly going for the real Mandarin in Shang-Chi means that being annoyed at this twist doesn't make much sense. Personally I think it works relatively well and the performance from Ben Kingsley elevates this twist even more. I love the ending even if Avengers Age of Ultron kinda makes it inconsequential. This movie has a really solid tone and I believe that this is the most underrated marvel movie. It's well done fun and it's relatively easy to sit and enjoy.,14-May-21,1.5,0.024,0.723,0.253,0.9861,,,,,,

Brian P,"Iron Man 3 was okay. This movie wasn't bad but it could've been better. The least interesting thing about Iron Man 3 is the villain. If you guys aren't aware of things this film, and Manet most of phase one and phase two are where the villains of Marvel are eh. The worst one was Malekith from Thor: The Dark World, and this guy Killigan is no different. He's one of those characters where he gets ignored in his young age and then gets rich turns evil he grows up. This is not a bad trope for superhero movies, in fact there are ways to do this storyline to make it fun an interesting, but here it doesn't. For me personally Killigan is one of the weakest parts of this movie and it does feel like it's dragging when he's on screen. The same thing goes for The Mandarin. He's okay. But it feels like they could've done better. Overall Iron Man 3 was still fun when the heroes show up and the arm of Tony having PTSD from the attack of New York was really the most interesting thing of this film. And I like his dynamic with the kid because that seems to set up his future dynamic with Peter Parker / Spider-Man. And the action scenes are really fun and sometimes thrilling.

V G,"The characters have always been my favorite part of any movie and therefore getting a whole movie, that focuses on character development, is definitely going to make me happy.

As someone who has to deal with anxiety myself, it's awesome and encouraging, to see someone I admire, struggle with, and overcome something similar.

The action is great, and even though the Mandarin twist angered a lot of comic book fans, I never read them myself and it was just genuinely funny. My main issue though is with the climax, which apart from that one shot of Pepper falling into the fire (which she somehow survives) is pretty dull compared to the first Iron Man or Avengers: Assemble.

Harry E,"Great ending to the Iron Man trilogy that shows us another side to the character. Really shows how superheroes struggle with trauma and mental health problems that hit a lot of viewers hard. Also the way Tony fights people without his suit is really cool and shows us some really cool gadgets. However, there are some really unnecessary side characters namely Maya Hansen and Harley Keener. Gwyneth Paltrow is better in this film but we see less of Don Cheadle. Trevor Slattery is a better bad guy than Aldrich Killian and he's just an actor. The final battle in general is really cool and we get the iconic plane scene were tony catches the people as they fall out of the sky. The fact that tony destroys all his suits is more metaphorical than literal as he has a new one in Age of Ultron and doesn't really hit home.

The movie is also more unhinged than previous MCU films which usually works well comedically but also has some downsides. While Iron Man is entertaining in this movie, he seems a little off mostly because the unhinged nature of the film plays a lot to his egotistical side and amplifies it.

Tudor P,"When I first saw Iron Man 3 back in 2013, I honestly disliked it a lot. I was expecting an action-packed Iron Man movie where Tony blows shit up. But that's not what Iron Man 3 is. Iron Man 3 is more of a Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man movie. If it were called Tony Stark - The Movie, I would have probably reacted more positively. I was also angry about what they did to the Mandarin character. I knew Mandarin from the 1994 Iron Man animated series. He was a powerful villain. But now he's just a false flag actor? What? That meant Mandarin could never appear in the MCU again. Look, I'm a fan of taking risks and subverting expectations, but not like this. Have the Mandarin be the actual Mandarin, but the twist is he teams up with Iron Man against Killian or something. I've watched Iron Man 3 a couple of times since it came out, and now I have a more positive opinion about it. The most interesting thing about it is Tony Stark having to deal with the trauma of the massive New York battle. This makes the MCU feel much more real, with consequences and repercussions. So that's the movie's strongest point. This movie also further fleshes out Tony Stark's character. Initially, Killian seemed to be a very interesting vilain. At first he's an ugly and awkward guy, he's a cripple, everyone treats him like crap. But later he develops the Extremis virus, modifies his body, becomes attractive and people start treating him better. It would have been a good opportunity for some social commentary. But in the movie he's just a bad guy. At the beginning Pepper is a bit surprised to see him and she's attracted to him, and Tony is jealous, but that's pretty much all they do with it.

I love that the movie focuses on Stark's PTSD coming from Avengers. This is the Stark's character being motivated by fear and ultimately leading to Ultrons creation. Feige said he wants to do different things with the third film, so he brings Shane Black. The director does what he is good at, Tony & Rhodey buddy cop. But the movie has a lot of other things going on, there is also a whole storyline with a kid, the kid was good but all things mashed together wasn't a great end product. Biggest unpopular opinion, the twist was goood. Ben Kingsley was perfect for a fake mandarin and as a con artist, 'I am an Acctorr'. Seeing back that we are getting Shang-Chi with real mandarin and Marvel making a short clip owing up their mistake and saying real mandarin still exist was great damage control. The villain was played great but felt short like all other marvel villains. Motivations... Seeing Iron Man rescue people from the plane was a breath of fresh air.

Despite the weak script, Hemsworth and Hiddleston still get their moments to shine. P.S. HOW DOES THIS HAVE THE SAME RT SCORE AS ETERNALS?",18-Mar-22,0.5,0.137,0.809,0.055,-0.8017,,,,,,
Kyle E,"This is in no way a knock on the first Thor because I enjoyed it a lot, but, as said with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World impressed me more. The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox",13-Mar-22,0.5,0.049,0.736,0.215,0.9974,,,,,,

Matthew D,"A funny and intriguing Marvel movie with the mighty Thor! Director Alan Taylor's superhero romantic fantasy thriller Thor: The Dark World (2013) is often maligned as Marvel's worst movie, but I found it enjoyable when I first saw it as well as after revisiting it now. Alan Taylor's direction is gripping, balancing strange fantasy elements like dark elves, silly comedy with Kat Dennings' blunt intern Darcy, and sweet romance drama between Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige entrusted Thor to Alan Taylor, who takes Chris Hemsworth's Norse god Thor into a tender romantic hero and quirky fun loving guy. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is not the celestial deity from Thor or The Avengers, but Hemsworth's Thor is still endearing and cool. Hemsworth's naturally funny charisma, buff physique, likable easy going personality, intense screen presence, and striking romantic charm all work in his favor as The God of Thunder Thor. Writers Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne, and Christopher L. Yost curiously dive into mythology to make Thor's new villains dark elves. The dark elves are neat folklore figures with dark imagery and atmosphere. However, Christopher Eccleston's creepy and commanding Malekith is not the most interesting Marvel antagonist either. I found the voluptuous Kat Dennings' Darcy a chipper source of comedy relief. Everything Dennings says as Darcy is hilarious to me. She's so dumb funny. Thor and Jane's tender romance feels authentic and heartwarming again with their cute rapport emotionally working on me again like in Kenneth Branagh's Thor. The fierce rivalry and brotherly bond between Thor and Loki is explored to a genuinely moving finale where loyalties and motivations are tested. There are actual character arcs in Thor: The Dark World. Natalie Portman is lovely and intelligent as scientist Jane Foster once again. I think her romantic chemistry with Chris Hemsworth really adds a lot of warmth and heart to Thor's Marvel movies. Tom Hiddleston's trickster god Loki is always funny, sly, and emotionally resonant. Anthony Hopkins has that peerless gravitas as Odin Allfather with Hopkins giving hard glares and stalwart emotional clarity in every one of his lines. Jaimie Alexander is so pretty and cool as Lady Sif. I wish Marvel had given her more action sequences and deeper characterization as Jaimie Alexander is an amazing actress. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson, and Tadanobu Asano are still exciting and funny as Thor's brothers in arms. Idris Elba's steadfast and solemn Heimdall and Rene Russo's moving mother of Thor named Frigga are fantastic like in Thor. Stellan Skarsgård is very funny and likable as Erik Selvig once again. Alice Krige is sincerely eerie as Eir. Chris O'Dowd gets cucked by Chris Hemsworth's masculinity in his love for Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Stan Lee's cameo is as charming as his other appearances in Marvel's movies. Chris Evans and Benicio del Toro's cameos are really neat and fun. Editors Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith's steady cuts keep Thor: The Dark World moving right along for an easy going fantasy adventure that does not drag too much in 112 minutes. Cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau uses these lovely ultra wide shots for the fantasy dark elves sequences, but as usual for me, I prefer the sleek and intimate close-up shots of Thor, Jane, Darcy, or Loki that are more emotionally revealing. John Bush's set decoration feels natural for Selvig's lab equipment, and grand for Asgard's golden realm of the gods. Art directors Julian Ashby, Mike Stallion, Ray Chan, Thomas Brown, Jordan Crockett, Mark Swain, Matthew Robinson, Hayley Easton Street, and Adriaan Engelbrecht craft a grim fantasy realm for the dark elves. I wish we got to see more of their bleak world as visual effects artists James Baker, Mike Stillwell, and Adrien Flanquart's CGI is impressive for the black shroud of magic infesting Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Composer Brian Tyler wrote a beautiful, melodic score for Thor: The Dark World. His symphony captures the brooding nightshade of the dark elves, gentle romantic feelings for Thor and Jane, as well as a touching melody of Loki's fateful choice. Costume designers Wendy Partridge, Ken Crouch, Alejandro M. Hernandez, Gia Jimenez, Jacqueline Shulman, Nigel Hyams, Kim Shek, Kurt J. Blackwell, and Jason Airey come up with neat outfits for everyone. I do wish there was more color to these costumes and more saturation in general in The MCU. The make-up crew did amazing work for the dark elves and main cast making everyone look amazing. In short, Thor: The Dark World is slightly underrated and very entertaining. It's solidly in the middle of Marvel's movies for me, not near the bottom.",28-Jan-22,1,0.041,0.676,0.283,0.9998,,,,,,
Mateo L,"No, I'm sorry, I can't with this movie. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's the worst in the MCU. It misses everything they built up in Thor. The character is still good, but the story there is no saving it. A villain with no personality, no reason to be, bland. I also think it's a big mistake that they gave so much attention to Darcy and the other supporting characters. Yes, sometimes they can be a good comic relief, but here they overdo it. Loki dying again but not really, it already feels too forced. I think many will agree with me that they don't even remember half the movie.

It's always watchable thanks to the stars Hemsworth (decent), Hiddleston (committed but occasionally over-the-top), Portman (not her best role), Russo, Hopkins (why?), and Eccleston (could have been anyone) with a sprinkling of Elba (best part), along with some decent action, but the attempts at humour float along listlessly in this film vacuous of ideas. The lengthy flashback at the beginning coupled with contextualization means that the main kickoff doesn't occur until nearly the halfway point, leading to an extremely rushed middle and a middling conclusion.",10-Sep-21,2.5,0,0.877,0.123,0.9331,,,,,,

Cailan D,"The Dark World is a textbook example of the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The action, dialogue, humor and story are all major letdowns from its predecessor. This movie also has the unconvincing and lackluster villain problem, as Malekith is underwhelming and doesn't add much to the film. It feels as though he there mostly because the movie needed an antagonist and he was just thrown in there, and he doesn't add much emotion to the movie and overall feels bland as a villain. The script tries to overcome this at a few points but fails to do so. Stellan Skarsgard is done very dirty in this movie with his character becoming a sort of ""crazy person""; this again adds little to the movie and is unnecessary. The actors do their best with their roles, but the chemistry isn't really there for the most part making the movie fairly boring. There are only two things about this movie that are worth watching it for: the interactions between Hemsworth and Hiddleston and the intro of the reality stone. Hemsworth and Hiddleston carry this film from start to finish and have a few nice and emotional moments, and the reality stone helps to further along the MCU storyline, giving viewers a legitimate reason to see this film. Other than that, Dark World is a huge letdown from its predecessor and remains today likely the worst movie released in the MCU.",19-Jul-21,3.5,0.12,0.787,0.092,-0.7564,,,,,,
May L,"I liked this movie, I really did, but it is probably the weakest movie in the MCU. The villain was severely underused, and such a catastrophic event causing so much distortion in reality would have certainly have attracted other MCU characters to the mix. Interestingly, even though the events, such as the aligning of the realms, were so big and catastrophic, we never hear about them ever again.

Flynn S,"Thor: The Dark World is not a bad movie. It's just a boring one. This movie is probably the perfect example of the ""Disposable CGI army"" stereotype and the fact that the villain's only motivation is the fact that they're evil.

Puroo R,"I hadn't watched any MCU movie until the release of Avengers: Infinity War, after which I had decided to bingewatch all the MCU movies so that I could catch up with everyone else before Endgame. Since I was practically skimming through all the movies, I only remembered the ones that had something absolutely memorable to show. This one, however, I barely remembered anything, except for the scene where it was shown in the end that Odin was actually Loki. That's not to say that this movie is bad. That's just saying it's... forgettable. Thor: The Dark World is a movie that I only remember in fragments. I remember a castle exploding in which Thor's mother died but nothing before or after that. I remember Loki being upset because he had been imprisoned and was throwing tantrums but nothing after that. Normally if a movie is so forgettable like it was in the case of X-Men: Apocalypse or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, I just watch the trailers, Honest Trailers, Pitch Meetings, Cinemasins etc to remember everything that happened in that movie. But I'm not gonna do it here. I want to see how much I can review based on what I thought of it on my first watching. The cinematography of this movie is pathetic, so is the CGI. Normally I prefer aliens having a bad CGI as in the case of Zack Snyder's Justice League since it gives a video game-like touch to it, but here it's just... trash. And what's the deal with the camera always being tilted sideways in many scenes? The characters were straight up terrible. The whole ""intern of an intern"" and punching Thor in the face to check if he's real (I don't remember if it was a slap or punch) wasn't even funny yet both the jokes happened twice. Also Thor hung his Mjolnir on a nail so that we could know it's not actually heavy. As I'm writing this review I'm remembering what all happened in it, but still not very nicely. I actually fell asleep while watching Thor: The Dark World, something I have never done for any other movie before. That's how slowly paced and boring it was. The talking scenes were a little too much and were barely audible. I think I really need to watch it one more time if I have to just get a basic idea of what it was. This could have been the MCU movie I hated the most if it wouldn't have been for Loki. He carried the whole movie on his shoulders. I remember all his scenes.",17-Jun-21,0.5,0.103,0.851,0.046,-0.9817,,,,,,

Harry E,Hmm. Not great. Chris Hemsworth is less of a Man-Child but that is pretty much it. Malekith is a very generic villain and the Warriors 3 feel less needed. Frigga's death hits home but the reveal that Loki is alive is unnecessary even if I liked him in this moving. Idris Elba reprises the role of Heimdall as does Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Both deliver good performances and generally feature more in this film. The dark elves look creepy and cool and the final battle is pretty good. The fact that Jane is in this film feels forced and I don't like it however it is made up for by the more amusing side of the film coming from Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard.

Malekith is unfortunately a forgetable villain. Just the generic evil bad guy who wants to destroy the world. He's a Dark Elf and wants darkness so that his people can thrive. But I feel like they should have maybe added a scene where we are shown that Dark Elves burn alive when in contact with light or something. Or show him feel sad when his people are killed. Humanize him a little bit. Because he just seems like the typical villain who wants to destroy the world.

Each to their own, as always, but I found it great. Loved the score, one of the more memorable ones from the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point. I also found the pacing to be near perfect, while the humour fits very well. The plot is entertaining. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, while Natalie Portman gives a performance worth noting - unlike in the original. I admit I wasn't overly happy to see Tom Hiddleston appear again, given his character isn't good enough to be in three MCU films, but he is satisfactory here. The rest of the cast are solid, too.

Almost fell asleep multiple times in the climax. Everything was just cheap teleportation that the movie thought it was smart doing. The only notable thing is the acting being good enough.

Hayden L,"Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, is another one of those MCU films where it's take it or leave it; If you enjoy Thor, and the different worlds aspect, you will enjoy this film, if you don't particularly care for it, you're most likely not going to like this film. I always try to give the Thor films the benefit of the doubt, due to it's hard to sculpt premise, but The Dark World wasn't one of those films that needed to be made. Even though Alan Taylor handled most of the aspects better than the first Thor, while somewhat keeping the continuity alive, The Dark World is just utterly forgettable, and almost disposable. Taylor set up a few decent expositions, but due to the fast pace, nothing carried through, becoming underdeveloped, and thrown away, with the tones being here, there, and everywhere. Taylor did his best by trying to give everyone more to do, but everyone was just so bland! Our returning protagonist do the best with what they're given, but all of the side characters, especially the human side characters, are just throw away. The creative team spent no time building anyone up besides our three leads in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tom Hiddleston. Chris Hemsworth returns once again as Thor, but there wasn't much added to his character. The writers spent too much time on trying to force the relationship between him and Natalie Portman, that ended up diminishing some of Thor's best qualities, to a certain extent. On the flip side, his relationship with Loki is captured great, being the best parts of the film. I wish I could say that Hemsworth carried the film, but he, himself said that he wasn't too crazy on it. Natalie Portman returns as Jane, just to take up time and space. The writers tried to make her a key piece to the narrative, but it did not pay off at all. I feel bad for Portman, because she's a very good actress; she just can't catch a break with these writers, writting her character. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he is questionably sidelined for most of the first half of the film, not having much to do at all. Even though I wasn't fond of him being put off to the side for the majority of the film, the writers gave him a nice grounded side to his character, while making a great impact to the film. The biggest issue I had with Malekith is, if you're going to have a great villain like Loki in the film before, you need to at least match the power, or out-do him, and Malekith is a flat out, laughable villain. His super underdeveloped motive is tremendously outplayed already. Christopher Eccleston tries way too hard to be a good villain, but he poses such a small threat, while just not fitting the scheme for Thor, or the MCU at that. Kurse on the other hand, definitely had the potential to be a decent villain, that poses and actual threat, but he was nothing but a disposable side character. The screenplay by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne & Christopher Yost, was the biggest downfall of the film. Most of their dialogue and jokes were forceful and bland, while they couldn't seem to find a tone to stick to. One of the best aspects of the film, was the action, backed up by the film wonderful effects. Out of all of the films so far, besides Marvel's: The Avengers, the action has been there, but not one of the highest points of the films; here, it's one of the main focuses, paying off pretty well by cutting down some dialogue scenes that could've been created. Overall, I came in HATING this film, but left somewhat enjoying it, and now seeing it just SLIGHTLY better than the first.",20-Jun-20,1,0.077,0.757,0.166,0.9974,,,,,,

And of course Loki himself played deliciously by ghe brilliant Tom Hiddleston and the ever expanding complicated relationship between him and his brother Thor.

Dmitry L,"Five years ago I didn't like a Marvel universe, but after I watched the guardians of galaxy, my opinion about this universe changed. I will tell about a second part of this movie. It'my favourite movie from Marvel universe. Second movie is telling us about Peter Quill and his company's adventures after events in the first part. This time Peter has accidently meeted his real father from other planet. After Ego(Peter's father) has told to Peter about himself and about his plans, Peter with his friends have understood, that Ego is one of the most danderous of villains in the universe and his plans can have terrible consequences for universe. The Guardians of galaxy vol.2 is very realistic Thanks to technologies, which Marvel studios used. Other stars, planets, aliens and starships is fancy and look as if they were real. Also the movie has a very good humor which can understand Both an adult and a child. Also in the cast there is of my favourite actors. It's Chris Pratt. I'm really enjoying his character.

Kyle E,"Having really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which was not quite as good as the hype but still very good, expectations were high for the sequel while being a little worried as to whether it would be as good or disgrace the first. The good news is that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' does not disgrace the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and is actually just as good. Like as was said with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is it as amazing as the IMDb rating (which is something that really shouldn't be taken to heart and is often blown out of proportion here on IMDb) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' well made and entertaining? Absolutely. A couple of the gags fall a little flat and the film does drag in the middle act. That's pretty much it for the complaints however. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2', reiterating what was said in my review for the first film due to having the same strengths, boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic, really making the toes tap. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much. James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at. Both 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films are far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction are in them as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' was written too, most of the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart. The story is mostly energetic and compelling, let down only by some of the middle act. At least however it doesn't have as many random misplaced moments and over sentimentality, even if it's not exactly original (not that that is a desperately bad thing). Characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character, but it's adorable and hilarious Baby Groot, scene-stealing Rocket and touchingly conflicted Yondu steal the show. Once again, like in the first film, Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Baby Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocket. Kurt Russell is an enigmatic presence and Michael Rooker is quite touching as Yondu. In conclusion, a lot of fun and very well made, every bit as good as the first, a few flat jokes and draggy middle aside. 8/10 Bethany Cox",14-Mar-22,4.5,0.088,0.674,0.238,0.9987,,,,,,

The film has a better story and a better villain than the first, but character development ends up taking a step back. With the sudden flanderization of the team, the only character to really survive this sudden change is Yondu who gets a lot of good development as a result. The sudden change in Rocket can also be excused as he gets some development to explain it, but no one else really has an explanation to his or her drastically changed personalities in this film. This does not ruin the film, but it does leave a slight scar on it when watching it again, especially nearly back to back with the original.

The only weakness lies in an over-saturation of what made the first film so special, which was the subtle humour mixed with classic music.

Nathan D,"This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film. Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top.

Jonathan K,"The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart. And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel ""this is funny"" or ""this is cool"", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad. The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie. The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is. Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got. If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time. You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed. In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",29-Jul-21,3,0.103,0.637,0.26,0.9953,,,,,,

Cailan D,"GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the ""sequel is worse"" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his ""new"" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",23-Jul-21,3,0.047,0.686,0.267,0.9984,,,,,,

Puroo R,"After the release of Infinity War, I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with everyone before Endgame comes. And of course I was watching them all very hurriedly. The memorable movies were the ones that I still remember very clearly to date (it's been nearly 3 years), while the ones that were terrible and a drag to watch, I forgot them instantly. I'd say this movie comes between the two categories, and as far as I can think right now, it's the only one to be in this exceptional category. No matter what everyone says, I absolutely hate baby Groot. Cuteness only suits on creatures we are used to perceiving as cute. And thus Groot, a tree, looks very, very awkward with those chubby cheeks. It seems as though that face wasn't meant to be on that body. Also the entire point of his innocence is very irritating, especially the part where he wanted to use Rocket's buttons in spite of him repeatedly telling him not to do it. That scene does not even make any sense, since other than that part Rocket and Groot seem to understand each other literally all the time. Groot becomes stupid or intelligent, strong or weak as the story demands it, which is why I absolutely hate him. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Though it feels as though there is too much yellow in the colour palette and the overall tone is more inclined towards the warm shades, the CGI world is marvelous to look at. Ego is a great planet to look at. I have seen Ego in the comics now so I can't believe they were actually able to translate him so well on the screen. Seeing the spaceship battles always kept me on the edge of my seat. It's just like how I was expecting the movie to become better as time progresses. But the way the conflict between Peter and Ego came was very bad. First of all, the way they bonded was wrong by their characteristics. Peter is a gullible guy who always thinks by his emotions while Gamora is the sensible one. Yet here Peter was the one suspecting Ego while Gamora wanted him to trust Ego. And then the way Ego revealed his mother's death, ugh! Why did he even need to say that! Firstly no matter how much you are in a flow, you'd never say something like that. And secondly if he knows so much about Peter, how did he not know saying that would make him angry? I really liked Mantis. I never understood why her character arc was about her being ugly. She looked way better than Nebula or Drax. She was kinda cute though. I couldn't hear any of Drax's jokes so I won't be talking about him. Yondu was also a very nice character. As much as I rolled my eyes seeing him in the movie, I really enjoyed seeing what he had become. His character development is fantastic, because of the redeemed person that he is. His whistling and shooting arrows was very much fun to watch. Overall this movie is a very mixed bag of opinions for me. I think it's really bad compared to the first movie, but at the same time really entertaining compared to most MCU movies. There is so much CGI, so much world building in GotG that I can't possibly hate it. I'm just gonna try to remember this one. I had forgotten everything about it except the good scenes, so I had to watch the Cinemasins video to remember it. I hope Volume 3 surpasses my expectations.",22-May-21,0.5,0.111,0.765,0.125,0.8262,,,,,,

Jerry S,"Everyone Always say it's either Guardians of the Galaxy, or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. For me, I really do like both of them. They are both good in a lot of ways and they both have a lot of flaws in a lot of ways. So let's get the flaws out of the way. For me the problem with this movie is how they handle Drax. For me I feel like they could've developed Drax a tad bit better. He has some really good moments with Mantis, and he can be pretty funny through most of it, but honestly sometimes he can get kinda annoying with his laugh but sometimes the laugh works. Another problem that I have with this movie is that some of it could be cut down just a little bit, and there are a few scenes that kinda feel like they don't have to be there. But otherwise. This movie rocks. I really like the history between Quill and his father. The relationship between Gamora and Nebula was really interesting, and as I said earlier some of the scenes between Drax and Mantis were really good. But by far my favorites scenes to watch are between Rocket and Yandu. These characters were so engaging. Just their history just really interest me and somewhat moved me. They were hands down my favorite parts of watching the film. I also thought Ego was much more of an interesting villain than Ronan. All in all Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not perfect but still a really good movie. I don't think that I'll ever have a favorite between these but for me I'm kinda leading towards Guardians of the Galaxy but at the end there are stuff that I really like in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but I guess I'll never know which movie that I prefer. 8.5/10",9-May-21,3,0.055,0.739,0.206,0.995,,,,,,

I actually didn't find the story in this as interesting as in the first film, but the humour - which is still up to the mark in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - is much greater here; it got more laughs from me, that's for sure. The ending to this is also entertaining. Chris Pratt and Co. are just as enjoyable as before, with Dave Bautista particularly standing out to me here; if only due to his amusing moments. I like the addition of Pom Klementieff, I can see a spot for her in the crew. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Debicki make for contrasting newcomers, Russell is just about good but I felt Debicki and her lot were underused/unintriguing. Not the most compelling plot, which I found more predictable than what the MCU usually produces, but the strong action end and noteworthy humour elevates it to become a pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original.",21-Jan-21,3.5,0.024,0.692,0.284,0.9948,,,,,,

Like the its predecessor, this is both funny and surprisingly heartfelt, considering the chaotic world of the Guardians. There is some wonderful character work in this. (The cast is great across the board.) I appreciate how much this feels like a natural extension of the first. So rarely do films and their character arcs have such clear progression. There are a couple issues I had. It felt like Drax (Dave Bautista) was dumbed down. Also, I like new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff), but there is the issue of the changes to her character in comparison to the original comics. Writer and director James Gunn has a fondness for making big changes to comic characters. Usually that works. Here, however, here we have a martial artist female hero transformed into a meeker, more reactive-than-proactive character; problematic. The whole thing looks great. The first film was distinctive, but this one raises the bar. The sci-fi designs are colorful and creative. The CGI in this is amazing. Really, I think this one of the greatest visual attempts in film. James Gunn's direction and incorporation of classic songs works so well. Overall, I can't stress how good this is.

Yes it drags but I love those portions as it settles the characters much more, much more dialogues and character moments. It also doesn't throw the villain at your face but builds relationships. Baby Groot is cute, Rocket does everything we loved about that character from first one. Rocket-Groot bomb sequence is one of my favourite sequence this movie is filled with many other comedy gold. Drax comedy is still my favourite, Peter having sexual emotion for Gamora and Drax screaming top of his lungs cracked me the most. Drax and Mentis just starting their weird relation. Gamora & Nebula's bonding thickens with fantastic toxic sister-sister relationships were explored. Peters relationship with his Father, being set up as a alien in first movie got good continuity and explains a lot more about Peter getting kidnapped by Ravengers. Peter at last playing ball with his father. Peter taking quick reaction of shooting his father just as he hear about tumor, Peter can't control his emotion. Yondu is the best daddy, his arc and redemption felt so emotional with original Ravengers returning to celebrate that beautiful funeral, heads off to the CGI department.

David A,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters. One of the best things that James Gunn did for this film, was not only flesh out all of the characters, but give them such a grounded tone, being able to mesh with the other Avengers seamlessly. With this film being centered around Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, again, we were able to dig deeper into his back story, and discover a lot of great layers to his character. He had so much to do, carrying the load on his shoulders, leaving him with the best character arch of the film. Zoe Sladana returns as Gamora, and she absolutely kills it this time! With her character being involved with a drastic plot point, it left her character to be fleshed out more, while becoming more grounded than before. Karen Gillan as Nebula got a lot more to do this time around, really giving herself, and Gamora the extra excitement and importance they both needed. We really didn't get too much more on Drax, played by Dave Bautista, but every time that man opens his mouth, it's comedy gold! With the nice addition of Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, it helped flesh his character out, subtly. Michael Rooker as Yondu, is the MAN! He gets so much more to do this time around, fleshing his character out nicely. His character is just so well written, allowing for great character moments. With Groot being pushed to the side, it allowed for Rocket Racoon, played by Bradley Cooper, to gain a tremendous bond with Yondu. The banter between these two characters was absolutely gut-busting! Rocket also has one of the better character archs of the film, fleshing his character out more, while keeping that charm everyone loves. I'm a fan of Kurt Russell, and I really liked him in the MCU, but the writters didn't give him enough space to breath, and be Kurt Russell. Even though he has one of the best back stories for a villain, while also posing a real threat, his character development was predictable. If James Gunn let him do his thing, I feel as if this film could've benefited from that Kurt Russell charisma. The issue this film had, it tried too incorporate too many villains, making everyone underdeveloped, and a waste of potential. Guardians 2 didn't rely on the action like the first film, but the few times it's there, it's super exciting, well shot, and backed up with immaculate effects. This is one of the MCU's best looking films. You didn't think that they would make a sequel and not absolutely kill it on the soundtrack again, did you? James Gunn and Tyler Bates came together once more to create another amazing soundtrack, that enhanced the emotion and tention in each scene. Overall, even though James Gunn ran into a few more issues than the first, he still managed to create a real fun experience!",17-Jun-20,2.5,0.032,0.758,0.21,0.9994,,,,,,

The dynamic between the characters is my favorite part about the guardians. So i was really bummed, that they split up the gang for half of the movie. The movie is still charming, watchable and enjoyable for sure. I still don't understand what they tried to do with the villain. This was supposed to be one of the most emotional fights in the MCU, but the execution leaves me wanting more. The biggest part of the movie they didn't even know, that he was a villain. In the end they save this movie with the comedy and Yondu. Yondu was my favorite character in this movie by far.

Joining forces with the Black Widow and a new ally, the Сaptain America and his team soon come up against an unexpected enemy. 3. The Acting is spectacular.

Kyle E,"That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",17-Mar-22,4.5,0.047,0.756,0.197,0.9967,,,,,,

Matthew D,"Captain America takes on spies! Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's superhero espionage thriller Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is very enthralling. I finally get the hype around the majority of audiences saying that The Winter Soldier is one of Marvel's greatest movies. The Russo Brothers capture thrilling action sequences with complex hand to hand combat for both Captain America and Black Widow that makes them look like excellently trained fighters. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust The Russo's with Captain America's second solo film. I loved that most of The Winter Soldier focuses on Captain America and Black Widow as these two Avengers superheroes make for the most interesting and believable spies for America through S.H.I.E.L.D. I personally appreciate Anthony and Joe Russo making a proper espionage thriller with real spy work and political intrigue as Hydra invades S.H.I.E.L.D. with covert tactics, hidden computers, and secretive files. It's very cool to see Marvel's Cinematic Universe give Captain America a chance to defend America with modern espionage skills alongside his awesome combat prowess. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely really came up with a neat spy narrative of Hydra's layered infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. from senators to soldiers alike. Their intricate spy story is fascinating as they blend sleeper cell agents like The Winter Soldier with Hydra's human experimentation and war mongering. They breathe life into Captain America's values as a patriotic American and moral man desiring a peaceful life. I was sincerely touched by the Steve Rogers segments where he goes to the Captain America museum exhibit to reminisce on old familiar sights, while deciding if he could ever date a woman that is not Agent Peggy Carter. Chris Evans is really heartfelt as Steve Rogers and inspiring as ever as Captain America. Evans plays up Rogers' emotions seeing Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter once more alongside Bucky in unfavorable circumstances. You completely understand and empathize with his conflicted ideals and feelings. Chris Evans embodies Captain America's kind spirit, steadfast bravery, and inspiring perseverance. Chris Evans is handsome, charming, funny, gentle, moving, strong, and likable as Captain America. Clearly a career defining role and performance from him. Scarlett Johansson is breathtakingly gorgeous as Black Widow as he takes out men like they're nothing in battle after battle. Scarlett's Natasha Romanoff charms with her sultry flirting and playful teasing of Steve Rogers. She's got great chemistry with Chris Evans and fits the espionage information seeking and cute romantic flirting. I am amazed by her Black Widow fight sequences with crazy acrobatic combat choreography besides her cool gadgets and quick thinking. Scarlett is simply charming and lovable as the former Soviet spy, who admires and befriends Captain America. Scarlett's Natasha Romanoff feels genuine, friendly, funny, and intelligent with her serious dramatic acting and subtle facial nuances. Scarlett Johansson will forever be one of Hollywood's finest actresses. I love her Black Widow in every Marvel movie thus far including Iron Man 2, The Avengers, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Hayley Atwell is genuine as ever as Peggy Carter with a wondrously touching scene with Chris Evans. I wish Marvel had given Agent Carter a proper role. Robert Redford is captivating as Alexander Pierce as he monologues about human safety and spy necessity. He feels right back in place with his subtle espionage acting like in 3 Days of the Condor or All the President's Men. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastically gripping as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury with his ethics speeches and motivational guidance for Captain America. His action scenes are really clever too. Toby Jones could not be more fun with just his distinct voice. Jones is always a staple of spy thrillers. Sebastian Stan is fearsome and brooding as The Winter Soldier. You can feel Bucky's confusion and determination as he kills person after person, while wondering who Captain America is to him. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson is funny and sincere as a patient veteran counselor, while also coming across as helpful and cool as Falcon. Cobie Smulders is wonderful as S.H.I.E.L.D's stalwart Agent Maria Hill with her sharpshooting and natural gravitas as a leader. Emily VanCamp is lovely and sweet as Sharon Carter. Her Agent 13 feels skillful and reliable with honest morals like Cap. Frank Grillo is easy to hate as Brock Rumlow. Garry Shandling's cameo is very funny. Stan Lee and Joe Russo's cameos are neat. Cool to see Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson already before Age of Ultron. Editors Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt continue a fast pace for 136 minutes of sharp cuts. The action flows nicely and the heavy dialogue of espionage exposition never lets you get lost with their natural edits. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch gives us steadfast wide shots for action and conversations so we see everything. I loved all the close-up shots and medium shots here with a real sleek look. All the sets, props, CGI, and sound design is impressive. Composer Henry Jackman's score for The Winter Soldier is an adrenaline rush for the action sequences, while creating a moody atmosphere for all the spy thriller elements. The espionage is the main plot and Jackman's tense music contributes a lot of emotion. Costume designer Judianna Makovsky creates slick uniforms for Black Widow, Captain America, and The Winter Soldier. In all, Captain America: The Winter Soldier remains thought provoking about government power extending too far and shadow games carried out by assassins and spies alike. I love the character development for Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff. The Russo Brothers pull off some of Marvel's most engaging action scenes with Captain America and Black Widow.

Ben N,"Steve Rogers is one of the best characters to come out of MCU. He's paired up with Natasha ""Black Widow"" in this story. I love her fighting style and 'grit' but her character is simply not given enough rope to work with - I guess she needs to remain 'mysterious' until her own movie. As a result their relationship fleshes out in a way I understand but do not ""feel"". By contrast, the Captain America figure is laid bare and we can see the different factions and emotions pulling at his deep seeded loyalty. I like this story as it gives a setting to his moralistic wrangling and, like us all, he just wants to see his choices make a difference and to feel like he has agency over his own life. The Winter Soldier idea is cool - the whole Shield is a shell that has grown the enemy within is not new, but was decently executed. Falcon seems to survive too easily. Does he even have 'superpowers'? He take a ton of punishment if not. The movie is too long - of course, all of these MCU movies are too long for an action flick. But I take at least two sittings to watch anything these days since I'm on my own couch anyway, so no big deal. I knocked off a star due to that length and the fact that very important dialogue to halfway decent plot is spurted out after a gut punch, or growled through gritted teeth, or whispered while explosions go off in the background, or shouted while a crescendo of 'dramatic' music flares too often.",27-Aug-21,5,0.051,0.849,0.1,0.9151,,,,,,

Cailan D,"The Winter Soldier is a treat to watch. The movie has fantastic cast performances from both the lead and supporting actors and some of the best action sequences we've seen in the MCU. The chemistry between Evans and Johansson is terrific and injects a lot of humor into a film with an otherwise very serious and mysterious nature. Winter Soldier does a great job of balancing emotions, character arcs and furthering along the MCU storyline through moments that may not seem too important upon a first viewing. Anthony Mackie is a welcome addition to the movie as Sam Wilson and he also has nice chemistry with Evans, setting him up well for future appearances as the character. The best thing about this movie is how it turns into a political thriller with a twist that has massive ramifications for the future of the MCU. The twist is well written into the story and is sure to keep viewers engaged, interested and invested in the characters and the franchise. Winter Soldier is also an uncommon instance where the sequel does better than its predecessor, in this case much better. There are some instances where scene continuity is questionable, but those instances take little away from the film. Winter Soldier to this day remains one of the best films in the MCU and set a bar for sequels that is difficult to live up to.",20-Jul-21,4.5,0.03,0.807,0.163,0.9782,,,,,,

El Nathan M,"I really like Captain America's simplicity. He does not shoot out lasers from his hands like Iron Man, he does not stick on walls like Spider-Man, he does not have absolute accuracy like Hawkeye, he does not have psychic powers like Doctor Strange and he isn't a Superman clone like Captain Marvel (although he's also supposed to be the poster boy of America who fought a billionaire). He's just a very strong man. His only weapon is a shield. Not even a sword, just a shield. It's a way of saying that his arms are no less than a sword. He doesn't fight long range. That's how much he trusts his skills. His costume is also very simple. It does not have any cape or coat. And unlike the comics, the MCU costume doesn't even have wings. They are just drawn on his helmet. And in this movie his costume is made even more sleek. I didn't like the stripes part from his costume. It looks too soft. It's like if he's stabbed over there he would die instantly. So this costume over here made that problem finish, plus it looks a lot more futuristic. I really wished Captain America only wore this costume. Another thing that shows Captain America's simplicity is the introduction to Falcon. Since The Avengers had already established that all the superheroes are now good friends of each other, this was the movie which could have shown their first partnership since the big team up movie (this was later done by Ant-Man instead for Falcon). But instead of calling them, Steve trusts a new friend, someone he made friends with while he was out on a jog, something similar to what the people used to do back in the mid 20th century. He also calls Black Widow for the action (ugh!), and together they find Hydra. In the end Captain America fights with the Winter Soldier, but instead of giving an actual fight, he tries pursuing him into giving up, something we won't expect a hero of such calibre to do. The fight scenes in this movie are pretty good, but what should I tell you? I mean it's a movie with Captain America, Black Widow AND Falcon. So there are over a dozen jump cuts every second during the fight scenes. This is the reason why I hate Natasha so much. She fights with so many scene cuts and never takes a single hit. She is the reason why I removed half star from my rating. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the best movie that came from phase 2 in my opinion. It completely outshadows its prequel and sets the correct tone for the additional characters in the future movies without causing too much disruption. It leaves many memorable scenes and has a very good story. I wasn't expecting to be disappointed from a Captain America movie because I like him for his simplicity, but I wasn't expecting to say it's gonna be one of the best MCU movies either. I'd definitely want to give it a rewatch if I get a Disney+ Hotstar subscription.",18-Jun-21,4.5,0.073,0.777,0.151,0.9917,,,,,,
Big Mojo W,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies ever made, not only is it a great MCU movie, but it's a genuinely great movie. This movie solidified the MCU and Captain America as a character for me, and it introduced Bucky, one of the best MCU characters for me. The idea of Hydra living on as a parasite inside SHIELD was an amazing concept and made for an amazing and interesting story that always kept you on the edge of your seat as you didn't know if your favourite characters were part of Hydra or SHIELD. And the reveal that Bucky Barnes is the Winter Soldier was not only shocking, but also heartbreaking. The fall of SHIELD by the end was amazing and Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce was amazing in this movie. Overall, great MCU movie and great movie.

If you are a Marvel, and/or Superhero movie fan, you may want to add a star; however; it is a good movie regardless of whether you are an Avengers nut, or not.

He manages to make the ""All-American"" soldier transitioning to his new life, in the modern era with depth and complexity that transcends the pages of a comic book. The action and special effects are first rate. The dialogue is witty and intelligent. The storyline is interesting when it stands alone, but as most people understand, it is interwoven into a much larger network of films, characters, and storylines.

The first Russo brothers MCU movie and the thing that stands out the most to me are the fight scenes (on the ship, the elevator, the heli-pad) -- some of the most visceral brawls I've ever scene outside of a John Wick movie. Oh,and they also do car chases REALLY well. The slightly flirtatious banter between Rogers and Natasha FINALLY teased some backstory on Black Widow, but what struck me the most is that it didn't really feel romantic for once. It felt like two very good looking people becoming friends. I think Iron Man and Thor would be better franchises without the romance. And who woulda thought that Bucky Barnes would become such a great villain/anti-hero? He was unrecognizable as the seriously as he was seriously powered and prettied up Winter Soldier. And the ambition. Hey, let's destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. while we're at it! And such a great ending: Falcon: ""You're going after him."" Steve Rogers: ""You don't have to go with me.""

I could easily recommend this movie to anyone, even to people who are not fans of the superhero genre. It's a very solid movie all-around.",1-Feb-21,3.5,0.025,0.738,0.237,0.9647,,,,,,

Devan B,This was definitely a top-tier level Marvel Movie. And it's definitely one of the most intense movies that I've seen within the MCU! I hope more MARVEL projects will tackle something like this in the future! And In my humble opinion; IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN Captain America - Civil War.,12-Jan-21,5,0.064,0.661,0.275,0.8936,,,,,,
Aaron F,"Amazing movie! The first marvel movie the Russo brothers did, and It's one of marvels best. The script was great by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It was great seeing Black Widow and Captain America in this movie together. Anthony Mackie was great as Falcon. The Winter Soldier was a great villain. Henry Jackman's score is brilliant. The winter soldier theme is so cool. The action is incredible in this movie so well choreographed. Great set up for Captain America: Civil War",10-Jan-21,5,0.064,0.581,0.355,0.9883,,,,,,
